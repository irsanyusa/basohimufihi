My tailoring and patterning career especially (which spans 34 years) has really wreaked havoc on my lower back.</p><p>While I’m aware that some mattresses (and pillows) can help alleviate some back pain, I’ve always put off purchasing a new one. The one I used before being given the chance to test out the Tempur-Pedic Luxe Adapt was a 10-year-old traditional spring coil with pillow-top that probably cost a couple hundred dollars. Before that, I had slept on the same inner spring coil pillow-top (that I had purchased used) for around 20 years. For some reason, a new mattress never made it to the top of my to do list, let alone a memory foam mattress. There was always something else that seemed more important and crucial to spend my money on.</p><p>Which is why I was extremely excited to try out the Tempur-Pedic Luxe Adapt. After a few weeks of sleeping on it, I’m ready to report my findings and observations.</p><h2 id=mattress-specifications>Mattress specifications</h2><ul><li><strong>Material:</strong><a rel=nofollow href=#>Tempur-Material</a> (Tempur-Pedic’s version of a memory foam), spring coils in base</li><li><strong>Firmness:</strong> Medium Hybrid</li><li><strong>Trial period:</strong> 90 nights</li><li><strong>Profile:</strong> 13 inches</li><li><strong>Warranty:</strong> 10 years</li><li><strong>Shipping method:</strong> White glove delivery and setup; haul away old mattress</li><li><strong>Price range:</strong> $3,799 to $7,598</li></ul><p><h3 class=title>Tempur-Pedic TEMPUR-LuxeAdapt Mattress</h3></p><h2 id=tempur-pedic-luxe-adapt-mattress-pros-and-cons>Tempur-Pedic Luxe Adapt Mattress pros and cons</h2><h3>Pros</h3><p>Tempur-Pedic mattresses are delivered via a white glove delivery service. In Manhattan, New York City, a company called<a rel=nofollow href=#> NVC Logistics</a> handles this. They bring the mattress all the way into your home and set it up where you want it. Removal of your old mattress is included.</p><p>Other pros of the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Tempur-Pedic Luxe Adapt</a> mattress itself include a breathable, washable and removable cover, pressure relief technology, ergonomic support and a deep 13-inch profile for those who have always been partial to the<a rel=nofollow href=#> Princess and the Pea</a> sleep aesthetic.</p><h3>Cons</h3><p>All of the foam-like Tempur-Material results in a very heavy mattress: the queen mattress that I received weighs 140 pounds and the California king mattress weighs around 170 pounds. This makes moving it a challenging prospect. I was able to manage that by myself though (sort of and not without some straining) as after the delivery service left, I decided to rearrange my entire bedroom. Like you do.</p><p>The use of a delivery service means that you have to schedule a day for it (obviously). The night before, you’re informed of the specific three-hour window for your delivery which can be slightly annoying if you have a busy life that requires you not being at home.</p><p>The other main con is that, like other foam material, it does have a faint smell — not necessarily a bad smell, just a smell. Thankfully, it goes away after a couple days though. Tempr-Pedic says that they allow all their mattresses to “rest” before sending them out on delivery so the majority of any odors are released before they make it into your home.</p><p>Read, Also: <a rel=alternate href=#>Best Queen Mattresses: Comfortable Options for Every Budget</a></p><h2 id=tempur-pedic-luxe-adapt-mattress-price>Tempur-Pedic Luxe Adapt Mattress price</h2><ul><li>Tempur-Pedic Luxe Adapt Twin Long: $3,799</li><li>Tempur-Pedic Luxe Adapt Queen: $4,299</li><li>Tempur-Pedic Luxe Adapt King: $4,999</li><li>Tempur-Pedic Luxe Adapt CA King: $4,999</li><li>Tempur-Pedic Luxe Adapt Split King: $7,598</li><li>Tempur-Pedic Luxe Adapt Split CA King: $7,598</li></ul><p><h3 class=title>Tempur-Pedic TEMPUR-LuxeAdapt Mattress</h3></p><h2 id=tempur-pedic-luxe-adapt-mattress-design>Tempur-Pedic Luxe Adapt Mattress design</h2><p>Originally developed by NASA to cushion pilots during test flights, Tempur-Material features the company’s proprietary technology for pressure relief and motion absorption. Constructed with an open cellular structure, it adapts to your weight, shape, and temperature. Heat generated from your body softens the material which allows it to continuously mold to your shape through the night. This isn’t as creepy as it may sound. Tempur-Material doesn’t collapse and sink like <a rel=alternate href=#>memory foam</a> does which can make people feel as if they are trapped in their bed. Memory foam also<a rel=nofollow href=#> hardens in cooler temperatures</a> which can be uncomfortable.</p><p>The medium hybrid version that I choose consists of Tempur-Material plus 1,300 individually wrapped premium springs. This combination creates a mattress that still has bounce and responsiveness while also providing pressure relief.</p><p>The Luxe Adapt is 13 inches thick (2 inches more that the Adapt model) and includes 4 layers: a 1.2 inch (3 centimeter) ventilated Tempur-Material on top of 2.4 inches (6 centimeters) of hybrid material followed by 1.2 inches (3 centimeters) of “advanced relief material.” All of this rests on top of the 1,300+ double stacked spring coils. The latter ensures edge support and allows for easier movement (you can get out of bed without sinking into the edge).</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/4682a0a9d018e6fe5c7915fbebd69e19/76902/mattress-lengthways.jpg></span></span><p>VANESSA NIRODE</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/fedd10dba374b347010751b5e06b4345/76902/mattress-depth.jpg></span></span><p>VANESSA NIRODE</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/0df335aee0f88155a47bebdce92353a2/76902/cover-unzipped-detail.jpg></span></span><h2 id=tempur-pedic-luxe-adapt-mattress-firmness>Tempur-Pedic Luxe Adapt Mattress firmness</h2><p>While I picked the medium hybrid version, soft and firm options are also available. I’m quite happy with the firmness level; it’s not so squishy that I feel as if I’m sinking into quicksand and not so firm that there is no give at all. Tempur-Pedic recommends this version for people like me who are upgrading from a traditional innerspring mattress because it still has the springiness that you’re familiar with.</p><p><a rel=alternate href=#>Mattresses</a> made completely with Tempur-Material or memory foam provide what many describe as an “in the mattress” sensation. The medium hybrid provides a more “on top of the mattress” experience, which works for me.</p><p>Plus, the spring coil construction in the bottom layer is great for people who suffer from arthritis or joint pain. Also like me.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/2be430a9a8e033a21813e1a6d9d1a3fd/76902/mattress-squish.jpg></span></span><p>VANESSA NIRODE</p><h2 id=tempur-pedic-luxe-adapt-mattress-support-and-comfort>Tempur-Pedic Luxe Adapt Mattress support and comfort</h2><p>Tempur-Pedic calls their Adapt series the most adaptive mattress ever. Which I guess is why they picked that name (haha). While I don’t necessarily have that much to compare it to, I genuinely find it comfortable and supportive, probably because of the 5-zone ergonomic support layer which includes specific regions for the head, shoulders, core, legs, and feet.</p><p>The zone beneath the core is the largest and helps keep your spine naturally aligned. The smaller zones on either side of the core cradle and conform to your hips and shoulders. I don’t feel any pressure no matter what position I sleep in and I’m both a side and back sleeper.</p><h2 id=tempur-pedic-luxe-adapt-mattress-performance>Tempur-Pedic Luxe Adapt Mattress performance</h2><p>After my first night’s sleep on my new Tempur-Pedic Luxe Adapt I wrote this:</p><p>Slept okay. Woke up a bit sore but that could be from wrestling the over 100-pound mattress around the day before. Rearranged my bedroom which could have contributed to my not achieving a deep sleep. Also, the weather was yucky (very humid and gross). Installed new curtains, too. Didn’t notice the smell while sleeping.</p><p>I’ve never slept on a mattress like this, or a mattress as expensive as this. It feels comfortable but also weird. I guess because it doesn’t move the way I’m used to a mattress moving.</p><p>I’ve grown to really like it as the days have gone by. And I’m happy to report that it no longer feels weird but rather, cozy and welcoming. Like many people, I almost always<a rel=alternate href=#> yearn for more sleep</a>. This mattress makes me want to spend the entire day in bed.</p><p><h3 class=title>Tempur-Pedic TEMPUR-LuxeAdapt Mattress</h3></p><h2 id=tempur-pedic-luxe-adapt-mattress-delivery-and-setup>Tempur-Pedic Luxe Adapt Mattress delivery and setup</h2><p>The mattress delivery, once I was able to pin down a day I would be available to receive it, was straight forward. As mentioned above, delivery in New York City is handled by NVC Logistics. My building requires a certificate of insurance for all deliveries (pretty commonplace in NYC) which the customer service representative I spoke to on the phone immediately forwarded to me.</p><p>The delivery itself arrived right on time at the top of the hour they told me they would be there. At 140 pounds, this is a heavy mattress and I live on the fifth floor of a walkup. The two delivery people carefully navigated all the flights of stairs; there’s a landing between each floor with 90 degree turns at every point, so it takes some finagling to move large, heavy things up to my apartment. They had to stop and rest half way up which is completely understandable. The only packing material was a clear plastic bag cover to protect the mattress while it was transported.</p><p>Both of the personnel were polite and courteous, stopping outside my door to put booties on before entering the apartment. Once inside they removed my old mattress and put the new one in its place in my bedroom. They then carried out the old one and hauled it away. I didn’t have to do anything.</p><p>All in all, a very positive experience.</p><h2 id=is-the-tempur-pedic-luxe-adapt-mattress-for-you-who-is-this-mattress-best-for>Is the Tempur-Pedic Luxe Adapt Mattress for you? Who is this mattress best for?</h2><p>I was a bit apprehensive at first because I’d never experienced a mattress like this before. I was worried I wouldn’t be able to sleep, it would feel uncomfortable or I’d wake up with new and varied aches and pains. None of that happened. After the first couple nights, I slept soundly, only waking up once or not at all during the night. In the past, it’s been common for me to wake up two or three times a night, so this is a definite plus.</p><p>This mattress is best for people like me who have never tried a foam one before, but want to for the potential health benefits while not giving up the ‘feel’ of a traditional spring mattress.</p><p>Read, Also: <a rel=alternate href=#>The Best King Size Mattresses for a Luxurious Night’s Sleep</a></p><h2 id=what-sets-tempur-pedic-luxe-adapt-mattress-apart-from-other-mattresses>What sets Tempur-Pedic Luxe Adapt Mattress apart from other mattresses?</h2><p>This particular mattress differs from many others by being constructed with both foam and coils—a true hybrid design. I don’t like the feeling of sinking into a bed, so I’ve always resisted investing in a foam-based mattress. This one delivers the best of both worlds. The removable, washable cover is also a wonderful feature.</p><h2 id=other-mattresses-from-tempur-pedic>Other mattresses from Tempur-Pedic</h2><p>In the Adapt family, Tempur-Pedic offers the<a rel=nofollow href=#> Adapt model</a> with an 11-inch profile and a<a rel=nofollow href=#> ProAdapt</a> with a 12 inch profile that provides 20% more pressure relief than the Adapt. (Read this in-depth <a rel=alternate href=#>Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt mattress review</a> for more real-life details.) The Adapt Luxe (the model I have) features a 13-inch profile and maximum pressure relief and is 30% more conforming to your weight, shape, and temperature than the lowest level Adapt.</p><p>For people who are hot sleepers, consider the<a rel=nofollow href=#> Tempur-Pedic Breeze Collection</a> which offers a ProBreeze model at 5 degrees cooler and LuxeBreeze at 10 degrees cooler.</p><p><h3 class=title>Tempur-Pedic TEMPUR-LuxeAdapt Mattress</h3></p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Is Tempur-Pedic Luxe Adapt good for back pain?</h3><p>Made with ultra-conforming Tempur-Material that absorbs the pressure of your body and joints, the Luxe Adapt is great for back pain. Mine has become almost nonexistent since I started sleeping on it.</p><h3>Is Tempur-Pedic Luxe Adapt good for side sleepers?</h3><p>With its 5-zone support layer, the Luxe Adapt is an excellent <a rel=alternate href=#>mattress for side sleepers</a>, providing cushioning for every curve and contour of your body.</p><h3>Is the Tempur-Pedic Luxe Adapt mattress too soft?</h3><p>Definitely not. While it feels slightly softer than a traditional innerspring mattress, it’s not so soft that there isn’t any support. Keep in mind that I tested the medium-hybrid version, so I can’t really comment on the too-softness of the soft version.</p><h3>Will couples enjoy the Tempur-Pedic Luxe Adapt Mattress?</h3><p>This mattress has very little, if at all, motion transfer, meaning if you toss and turn or get up a few times in the night, you probably won’t disturb someone else sleeping on the other side. If you accidentally kick them or fling an arm on them, though, this mattress won’t help you. Unless, of course, they’re sleeping so soundly and peacefully, they don’t even notice.</p><p>The low motion transfer also means that you likely won’t be disturbed by any of your canine or feline family members jumping into bed in the middle of the night.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final verdict</h2><p>The Luxe Adapt is a high-end, ergonomic, supportive, and comfortable mattress that will benefit a wide range of people, especially those who suffer from aches and pains. The medium hybrid model is a perfect solution for transitioning from a traditional innerspring mattress as it provides bounce from its individually wrapped coil layer and support from its Tempur-Material foam layer. Spending over $4,000 on a mattress is likely a major purchase for many people, but with Tempur-Pedic’s 90-day trial period, it’s worth trying one out if you’re able. You might just fall in love with it like I did.</p><p><h3 class=title>Tempur-Pedic TEMPUR-LuxeAdapt Mattress</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme9OepKmtomK9prDInGSlraiaeqKwwKmrZqqVq7amw44%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftempur-pedic-luxe-adapt-review.html&text=Tempur-Pedic%20Luxe%20Adapt%20Review%202024&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftempur-pedic-luxe-adapt-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftempur-pedic-luxe-adapt-review.html&title=Tempur-Pedic%20Luxe%20Adapt%20Review%202024" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftempur-pedic-luxe-adapt-review.html&title=Tempur-Pedic%20Luxe%20Adapt%20Review%202024" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftempur-pedic-luxe-adapt-review.html&title=Tempur-Pedic%20Luxe%20Adapt%20Review%202024" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftempur-pedic-luxe-adapt-review.html&description=Tempur-Pedic%20Luxe%20Adapt%20Review%202024" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./x-twitter-disinformation-israel-hamas-1235749352.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="X/Twitter Accused of Spreading Disinformation About Israel-Hamas War">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./unicorns-signature-sally-el-hosaini-james-krishna-floyd-1235875129.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sally El Hosaini and James Krishna Floyds LGBTQ Romance Unicorns Acquired by Signatur">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
