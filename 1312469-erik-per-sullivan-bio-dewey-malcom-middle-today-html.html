The film was all about a dysfunctional family centered around Malcolm, who is one of the children in the family. All the central characters have significantly transformed, looking quite different from what we have known them to be. While some continued their movie career, others switched careers.</p><p class=align-left>Today, the former actor is far from the fantastic young kid back then. His current physical stature is totally different from the character, Dewey from <i>Malcolm in the Middle</i>. Erik Per Sullivan now has a height of 5 feet and 9 inches, which is equivalent to 175 centimeters. He was just 14 years when the show <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ended in 2006</a>.</p><p class=align-left>The 12-year transformation also includes a silent acting career as some suggest that he retired after the last movie, <i>Twelve</i>, in 2010. The big breakout in the family series, <i>Malcolm in the Middle</i>, was Bryan Cranston. Today, he is famous for his role in another TV series, <i>Breaking Bad</i>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b93af3374ba50cce.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sodapoppin (Chance Morris) biography: age, net worth, girlfriend, ban</span></p></a><h2>Erik Per Sullivan movies</h2><p class=align-left>Sullivan was first seen on stage at seven years old. He was featured in a minor role in the 1998 film, <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Аrmаgеddоn</a></i>. Immediately after that, he was set for the 1999 movie, <i>Тhе Сіdеr Ноuѕе Rulеѕ</i>. His acting skills must have been that good for movie producers to feature him in another movie titled<i>Wоndеrlаnd</i>, in 2000.</p><p class=align-left>In 2000, Erik got his big break when he became the famous Dewey Malcolm in the Middle. He was one of the major cast in the TV series that lasted for six years. Erik, as the little Dewey Wilkerson, appeared in more than 100 episodes of the TV series. The young actor voiced for different animated movies like <i>Meatballs Finkelstein, Finding Nemo, </i>and <i>Arthur and the Invincibles.</i></p><p class=align-left>Erik Per Sullivan movies and tv shows include <i>Unfaithful, Joe Dirt, Wendigo, The King of Queens</i> (acted in 2002), <i>Christmas with the Kranks, </i>and <i>Come on Over</i> (where he played Young Luis). His latest movie was released ten years ago. In the movie, <i>Twelve</i>, Sullivan played the role of Timmy, and since then, many fans have been curious about what happened to Dewey from Malcolm.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5eb0bf0455194224.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jonathan Cheban biography: who is Kim Kardashian’s friend?</span></p></a><h2>How much is Erik Per Sullivan worth?</h2><p class=align-left>The Swedish-American is worth <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$3 million</a>. All his earnings come from his active young days. Although for some time now, the young actor has focused more on his education than his career. However, Erik Per Sullivan net worth has remained in balance. This could be due to the modest lifestyle he is known for.</p><p class=align-left>At 28, there is definitely more to come out from the former American kid star.
