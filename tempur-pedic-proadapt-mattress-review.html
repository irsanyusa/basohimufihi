For years I was on the hunt for a good mattress, but I narrowed my options based mostly on price and convenience, leading me to buy and discard three different memory foam mattresses in four years, each one more disappointing than the last.</p><p>My main issues across all the memory foam mattresses were back and neck pain, and heat. Full disclosure, I don’t have any diagnosed neck or back issues—the discomfort I was feeling was almost solely because of the mattresses and pillows I was using. And especially through Texas summers, the dense foam seemed to hold heat, despite an array of <a rel=nofollow href=#>cooling sheets</a>, ceiling fans, and cranked-up AC.</p><p>Feeling a bit like Goldilocks, I tried the <a rel=nofollow href=#>Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt Mattress</a>, and everything changed. I had previously ruled out brands like Tempur-Pedic due to the higher price tag, but considering I had spent over $3,000 on numerous mattresses that were supposed to be saving me money, I decided to take a different approach, and I’m glad I did.</p><p>Before I dive into the review, there are a few things you should know about the Adapt mattress line.</p><ul><li>The Adapt mattress line from Tempur-Pedic has three models—Adapt, ProAdapt, and <a rel=alternate href=#>LuxeAdapt</a>.</li><li>Each level comes in several feels, or firmness levels. Those options vary based on which model you choose.</li><li>The prices vary based on the model and size you choose, but not on the firmness level.</li></ul><h2 id=mattress-specifications-medium-hybrid>Mattress specifications (Medium-Hybrid)</h2><ul><li><strong>Material:</strong> Tempur-material memory foam, premium-wrapped coils</li><li><strong>Firmness:</strong> Soft, medium, medium-hybrid, firm</li><li><strong>Trial period:</strong> 90 nights</li><li><strong>Warranty:</strong> 10 years</li><li><strong>Shipping method:</strong> Free shipping with white-glove delivery</li><li><strong>Price range:</strong> $2,899–$5,798</li></ul><p><h3 class=title>Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt Mattress</h3></p><h2 id=tempur-pedic-proadapt-mattress-pros-and-cons>Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt Mattress pros and cons</h2><h3>Pros</h3><ul><li><strong>Ultra pressure relieving.</strong> The quality of Tempur-Pedic’s memory foam was immediately apparent as soon as I laid down. I felt relief in my neck, shoulders, hips, and lower back. Most importantly, this support didn’t waiver throughout the night—I felt a difference waking up after just one night of sleep.</li><li><strong>Machine-washable cover.</strong> The ProAdapt comes with Tempur-Pedic’s SmartClimate dual cover system, which is removable and machine-washable. As an allergy-sufferer, and someone who usually invests in a separate <a rel=alternate href=#>mattress protector</a>, I appreciate this feature. It’s easy to remove and throw in with your sheets, or by itself, and I have found that it doubles as an adequate allergy protector.</li><li><strong>Buildable.</strong> In my opinion, one of the great things about a Tempur-Pedic mattress is that it’s buildable, which means you can build out your full set gradually, in a way that’s affordable to you. Once you’ve purchased the mattress itself, you can take your time upgrading to one of the bespoke foundations (including the adjustable powerbase) or a set of Tempur-Pedic sheets and <a rel=alternate href=#>pillows</a>.</li><li><strong>Options for all types of sleepers.</strong> The range in firmness levels that are only available with the ProAdapt model makes this one of the best <a rel=alternate href=#>mattresses for side sleepers</a>, stomach sleepers, back sleepers, or combination sleepers. You’ll get the same quality and price—you only need to decide which firmness level, or feel, is right for you.</li></ul><h3>Cons</h3><ul><li><strong>Price</strong>. Obviously the $2,500+ price tag stands out to many of us, and as consumers we would love it if this fabulous mattress were available for under $1,000. But put an asterisk next to this one, because I do think that the price is worth the quality and longevity.</li><li><strong>May require you to purchase a new bed frame, base, or foundation.</strong> You can’t use this mattress with regular old box springs. Box springs are designed with too much “give” that’s made to work with a traditional spring <a rel=alternate href=#>mattress</a>. The Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt needs a firmer base. Between the mattress, and possibly needing to upgrade your frame, base, or foundation, it can make for an overall hefty investment.</li></ul><h2 id=tempur-pedic-proadapt-mattress-price>Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt Mattress price</h2><p>The price range of this particular mattress starts at $2,899 for a twin, and goes up to $5,798 for a king or split king. This is the middle price range for the different Adapt mattress line options, which can get as expensive as $7,598 for a king.</p><p>Keep in mind this reflects the price of the mattress—you’ll need a compatible base, which could be an additional cost.</p><p>If you’re dragging your feet about the price, Tempur-Pedic offers 0% APR financing for 36 months if you qualify for their credit card. There may also be additional financing options if you purchase the mattress through other retailers. You also may consider downgrading from a <a rel=alternate href=#>king mattress</a>, or even a <a rel=alternate href=#>queen mattress</a>, to save without sacrificing the quality.</p><h2 id=tempur-pedic-proadapt-mattress-design>Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt Mattress design</h2><p>The Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt is made with Tempur-Pedic’s proprietary memory foam, originally created by NASA to cushion pilots during test flights. It’s designed to be better than other memory foam at absorbing motion, relieving pressure, especially around the body’s pressure points and adapting to your body’s movements and temperature all night long.</p><p>The medium-hybrid option has several layers of foam atop premium-wrapped coils for added support. The whole thing is wrapped in a cooling, removable cover that’s white and light blue on the top and dark at the base—the typical Tempur-Pedic design.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/c8ad5e38b2048e6ca4315e7ac15ef918/76902/img-3245.jpg></span></span><p>Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt Mattress design</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/5809cdf776162074ffaad3744d6546d4/76902/img-3239.jpg> </span></span><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/5e6554593ae91d88d51878fac685e25e/76902/img-3241.jpg></span></span><h2 id=tempur-pedic-proadapt-mattress-firmness>Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt Mattress firmness</h2><p>The Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt comes in four firmness levels—soft, medium, medium-hybrid, and firm. These four are only available with the ProAdapt model.</p><p>Mine is a medium-hybrid, a combination of the proprietary memory foam with more traditional coils, and what Tempur-Pedic describes as their “meet in the middle” option. It is, as described, a great hybrid of the Tempur Memory Foam supported by over 1,000 premium-wrapped coils.</p><h2 id=tempur-pedic-proadapt-mattress-support-and-comfort>Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt Mattress support and comfort</h2><p>Compared to the softer firmness levels, I feel incredibly supported all night, particularly my neck and shoulders which were problem areas. The mattress is comfortable and soft, but doesn’t have the give common to all foam mattresses that ends up putting strain on my shoulders and lower back as I sleep.</p><p>Contrary to the firmest level though, the layers of foam still provide that “sinking in” feeling. The cradling foam combined with the firm support makes for an optimal comfort level that’s also just cozy.</p><h2 id=tempur-pedic-proadapt-mattress-performance>Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt Mattress performance</h2><p>I have been nothing but pleased by the way the mattress performs, and it’s kept all the promises made in the product description. This mattress is cooler than any I’ve had, despite the dense and supporting feeling of the foam. It limits motion transfer, which is key when sleeping with a partner. It also cured my back and neck pain, virtually overnight. Overall, my quality of sleep is way up.</p><p><h3 class=title>Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt Mattress</h3></p><h2 id=tempur-pedic-proadapt-mattress-delivery-and-setup>Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt Mattress delivery and setup</h2><p>The Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt Mattress comes with free white-glove delivery, which essentially means the delivery service sets everything up for you. When my mattress was delivered, the company was communicative, found my apartment easily, and brought up and unboxed the mattress and foundation within minutes. Afterwards, they removed the large boxes and wrappings—it was like no delivery had even taken place.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/63720ae587f7c4bafe9385d0020771a0/76902/img-1114-1.jpg> </span></span><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/065fc3e41a348a7d05a438cd2ab9d43a/76902/img-1116.jpg></span></span><h2 id=is-the-tempur-pedic-proadapt-mattress-for-you-who-is-this-mattress-best-for>Is the Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt Mattress for you? Who is this mattress best for?</h2><p>Due to the price and quality, the Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt Mattress is best for someone who is looking to invest in a mattress long term, particularly someone who has struggled with sleep and back pain.</p><h2 id=what-sets-tempur-pedic-proadapt-mattress-apart-from-other-mattresses>What sets Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt Mattress apart from other mattresses?</h2><p>Tempur-Pedic’s proprietary memory foam material—developed by NASA and adapted by Tempur-Pedic for sleep—is a major standout for the ProAdapt mattress, and all <a rel=alternate href=#>mattresses that use the memory foam</a>. I would say that the quality, durability, and adaptability of this mattress at its price point is also something that stands out.</p><p>Tempur-Pedic as a company focuses on educating customers and potential customers about all aspects of sleep. Despite my receiving a mattress to test for review from the brand, I spent several hours in my local Tempur-Pedic store. Over the course of several visits, I tested several mattresses and pillows in a comfortable and sanitary way. The rep I worked with was focused on making sure I understood what each firmness level should feel like, and how it fits with my sleeping style. As a result, I was confident with the mattress I chose, and satisfied once I received the mattress.</p><h2 id=other-mattresses-from-tempur-pedic-proadapt>Other mattresses from Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt</h2><p>The TempurAdapt mattress line comes in three models—the Adapt, ProAdapt, and LuxeAdapt. Each one is available in different firmness levels. The Adapt is the most basic and most affordable of the three, and comes in medium and medium-hybrid firmness levels with a cooling cover that’s not removable.</p><p>The LuxeAdapt is the most expensive of the three options and sports the most features. Compared with the ProAdapt, it has an additional supportive layer of memory foam and a higher profile, but it’s only available in three firmness levels—soft, medium-hybrid, and firm. Compare the price ranges for each below:</p><ul><li>Adapt: $1,699–$3,398</li><li>ProAdapt: $2,899–$5,798</li><li>LuxeAdapt: $3,799–$7,598</li></ul><h2 id=tempur-pedic-proadapt-mattress-frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt Mattress frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Is the Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt mattress hot?</h3><p>No. The ProAdapt features Tempur-Pedic’s SmartClimate dual cover system, with two removable and washable covers that are cool to the touch and promote temperature regulation. The layer of ventilated Tempur material in the mattress also promotes airflow, and is made to adapt to your temperature all night.</p><h3>Is the Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt Mattress good for back pain?</h3><p>Yes. The Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt in medium-hybrid or firm is a good <a rel=alternate href=#>mattress for back pain</a>, particularly lower back pain.</p><h3>Is the Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt Mattress worth the price?</h3><p>In my opinion, yes. If the Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt Mattress is within your budget, the quality, comfort and longevity is well worth the price.</p><h3>Does Tempur Memory Foam get softer over time?</h3><p>While Tempur Memory Foam doesn’t necessarily get softer over time, it does <a rel=nofollow href=#>break in with use</a>, similar to the way a pair of shoes adapts to the shape of your foot. Tempur Memory Foam is also temperature-sensitive, meaning it can feel softer in temperatures over 72 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><h2 id=final-verdict>Final verdict</h2><p>Overall, the Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt has delivered on its promises, and it’s certainly made a difference in my comfort and quality of sleep. I think you’ll have a similar experience as long as you take the time to research the best fit for your sleeping style. If you’re able, I’d recommend combining preliminary research with at least one visit to your nearest Tempur-Pedic store to test the firmness levels in real life.</p><p><h3 class=title>Tempur-Pedic ProAdapt Mattress</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme9OepKmtomK9prDInGSpqp%2BWsaK802akmqykp7K0v4yrnK%2Bhlax8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftempur-pedic-proadapt-mattress-review.html&text=Tempur-Pedic%20ProAdapt%20Mattress%20Review%202024&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftempur-pedic-proadapt-mattress-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftempur-pedic-proadapt-mattress-review.html&title=Tempur-Pedic%20ProAdapt%20Mattress%20Review%202024" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftempur-pedic-proadapt-mattress-review.html&title=Tempur-Pedic%20ProAdapt%20Mattress%20Review%202024" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftempur-pedic-proadapt-mattress-review.html&title=Tempur-Pedic%20ProAdapt%20Mattress%20Review%202024" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftempur-pedic-proadapt-mattress-review.html&description=Tempur-Pedic%20ProAdapt%20Mattress%20Review%202024" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-women-find-older-men-so-attractive-747960.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Women Find Older Men So Attractive">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./parfois-malmenee-lintercommunalite-espere-se-voir-confortee.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Parfois malmene, l'intercommunalit espre se voir conforte">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
