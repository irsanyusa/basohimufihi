The argument was essentially that <strong>lifting the ban smacking</strong> would help to <strong>put an end to rioting, gangs and knife violence.</strong></p><h3>This week, we queried our panellists on why smacking<strong> should</strong> or <strong>should not be allowed</strong> when reprimanding a naughty child and, if not, <strong>what sort of alternatives</strong> they could suggest for parents who are at their wits' end.</h3><p>Many of you said that the act of smacking counts as <strong>child abuse and lazy parenting</strong>. Others however felt there is <strong>a clear distinction between ‘smacking’</strong> which is an effective disciplinary tactic, <strong>and ‘abuse’</strong> which can be carried out in a variety of ways that are harmful to the child, and would be done so whether there are laws against smacking or not. So what do you think?</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/LabsLine.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h2><strong>Reasonable chastisement or a form of child abuse? Is the end of smacking a crackdown on misused corporal punishment or simply an overreaction?</strong></h2><h2><strong>Join the debate by using Disqus below!</strong></h2></p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/LabsLine.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Here’s what our poll participants had to say: <strong></strong></p><h2><strong>1.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Smacking *should* be allowed</strong></h2><p><h3><strong>Argument 1 - Smacking is not abuse</strong></h3></p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/notabuse_formatted.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“<strong>There is an obvious difference between discipline and abuse that the majority of parents appreciate</strong>. It is more harmful for children to grow up with no control or discipline in their lives and has led to many of the stigma faced by young people today”</p><p>“There is a<strong> difference</strong> in tapping or smacking to rectify a behavioural problem and hitting a child and losing control.<strong> If a child is chastised by smacking in a loving environment where the majority of the time the child is shown that they are valued and loved</strong> then the occasional smack will not harm their development”</p><p>“Firstly, because<strong> a 'reasonable' smack is a short term pain that tells the child in no uncertain terms that he/she must follow the rules</strong>. Secondly, because <strong>shouting at the child, I think, is more traumatic</strong>. Either the child turns out to be a bully or else becomes introverted and fearful of others”</p><p>“They say that <strong>hitting an adult is never acceptable, so nor should hitting a child be</strong>...If I shut an adult in his or her bedroom and refused to let them leave the house, I would be guilty of false imprisonment. If I confiscated an adult's property, I would be guilty of theft. Will the anti-smacking lobby make it impossible for parents to do this to a child too? <strong>Should adults only be able to punish a child after the case has been brought before a court or another legally constituted tribunal?</strong> For that matter, why shouldn't children have the vote?”</p><p>“Smacking is down to the individual. <strong>There will always be parents who misuse smacking, but that is because they are not good parents</strong>, and does not mean that smacking in itself is not an acceptable form of disciplining children”</p><h3><strong>Argument 2 - It prevents worse outcomes</strong></h3><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Prevents-worse_formatted.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“<strong>A smack is much less serious than an accident</strong> - such as running into the road. <strong>Memory of a smack reminds a child not to repeat the behaviour</strong> that earned the smack in the first place”</p><p>“I stopped smacking my son when he was young and<strong> he has turned out to be an arrogant, ignorant, abusive teenage thug.</strong> If I had known then what I know now I would have continued as he would have learnt what it is like to receive what he dishes out”</p><p>“My eldest was obsessed with playing with fire. Finally, <strong>for fear of him burning down the house, having tried all other methods, I smacked him</strong>. As a last resort and shock tactic it seemed to suddenly reinforce the message of fire being dangerous and <strong>he at last registered that I really meant what I said.</strong> I believe that <strong>this one slap probably saved lives if not huge damage</strong> to property”</p><p>“I have seen how children who were smacked for misbehaving have <strong>realised they will not be allowed to misbehave in that way again</strong>; they have learnt what is and what is not acceptable. I have also seen how <strong>children who are not smacked when necessary treat their parents and subsequently all authority figures with utter contempt</strong>”</p><p>“There are instances when a smack is for their own safety. <strong>When they persist in running towards the road, climbing where it is dangerous and a firm corrective 'no' has been repeatedly ignored.</strong> They are so small that they cannot understand the concept of being seriously injured or dead. The situation requires a lightning response from a parent or carer -<strong> there is not time to discuss it!</strong>”</p><h3><strong>Argument 3 - It's a natural act</strong></h3><p>“It is natural; <strong>all young mammalian creatures in the wild get smacked when out of line</strong>. Children learn to behave and not overstep their limits and grow up polite and caring”</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Natural_formatted.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“<strong>It’s worked for thousands of years</strong>, why would we be so arrogant to think we can do better?”</p><p>“A small tap on the hand of very young children with the word NO enforces just what is wrong and right. They must learn who is boss. <strong>If you observe animals, they do the same</strong>”</p><p>“Smacking is a natural reaction to punish bad behaviour. <strong>Children, themselves, from a very young age, tend to smack anyone who wrongs them, even if it's their parents who they're upset with</strong>. Therefore, smacking is really the language that children understand”</p><p>“In the animal world <strong>you can often see an animal smack its offspring</strong> to bring it under control”</p><h3><strong>Argument 4 - It's effective</strong></h3><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Mosteffective_formatted.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“<strong>I tried everything with my own son</strong>, stopping pocket money and treats, sending him to bed - removing all electrical items from his room first (including the light bulb!), ignoring him, amongst many other things. <strong>Only smacking worked in the end</strong>”</p><p>“I have seen first-hand children whose parents have tried to ‘reason’ with them, children who are not stopped from behaving in anti-social ways, and I can never like these children. I have also seen<strong> children that were given a smack for bad behaviour; they have grown into much better, well-adjusted adults</strong>”</p><p>“Obviously you can try and discuss the reasons why behaviour is wrong with a child but <strong>please let me know how you accomplish that with a child who is so young they have not yet learnt to speak</strong>”</p><p>“The <strong>naughty step or time out method</strong> can be used but in my experience, this <strong>is often not constructive and a child quite simply forgets why they have been banished there</strong>. Certain children will persist in the act for which they are being punished”</p><p>“My brother used to put his toy racing car aerial in a socket and it would spark. <strong>My mum declared him old enough to be explained to and not smacked</strong>. After repeated explanations and warnings of other punishments, he still did it. <strong>One time it blew him across the room, this still didn’t stop him trying. </strong>My dad gave him a smack on the bum,<strong> he never did it again”</strong></p><p>“They say to reason with a child instead. <strong>If a child is capable of reason in every instance, perhaps we should make all children criminally responsible?</strong> Sometimes, a child will simply try to assert his or her will, not matter what the cost to others, or to themselves”</p><h3><strong>Argument 5 - All punishment is unpleasant<strong></strong></strong></h3><p>“<strong>It is difficult to see how any type of discipline may not be seen as harmful.</strong> The object is to challenge unacceptable behaviour. Whether it is physical, verbal, or emotional, we are 'harming them'.<strong> Is it more harmful to call your child hateful disparaging names or smack them? Both are harmful yet there is only law for one”</strong></p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Punishment-meant-to-be_formatted.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“Not all smacking is done in anger. I was smacked and when it happened I felt my parents were NOT lashing out at me or simply hitting me but punishing me in sadness. <strong>I disliked all my parents’ disciplinary methods, naturally! But it felt just</strong>”</p><p>“Failing to smack a child when that is what is needed <strong>shows a lack of love for the child</strong>”</p><p>“Of course parents should be allowed to discipline their children by administering an appropriate smack to the legs or hand, if the child is ignoring all verbal attempts at discipline. <strong>Allowing a child to come to their own conclusion as to when they do as they are told is simply sloppy parenting </strong>and is basically saying ‘I am unable to control my child because<strong> I do not have the moral fibre</strong> to do so’“</p><p>“<strong>Any punishment is unpleasant, that is why it is punishment</strong>. An occasional smack is not too painful, is over and done with in an instant and is far less harmful to the child than several other forms of punishment I have heard being suggested as an alternative. As I have already said, being ALLOWED to smack doesn't mean you will ever have to do it anyway”</p><p>“Just about all methods of discipline work, but none work with all children. A smack is quick and immediate. <strong>A bit of discomfort helps the learning process</strong>”</p><h3><strong>Argument 6 - It should only be used properly<strong></strong></strong></h3><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Discipline_formatted.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“The child <strong>must be immediately told WHY they were smacked</strong> otherwise they will not learn from it”</p><p>“<strong>I don't believe they should be smacked in the face</strong>. They are just children. You cannot enforce discipline that way”</p><p>“I smacked my kids when needed and played with them and read to them; as<strong> it must also be shown to them that you are not just someone who dishes out punishment but also loves them</strong>”</p><p>“Smacking must be <strong>administered in an unemotional way</strong> and must<strong> follow immediately after the offence</strong>. It must not be used as a routine punishment but is effective if used properly”</p><p>“Preferably smacking would <strong>not be done in public or in front of peers,</strong> which might make the child the subject of teasing”</p><p>“Whether the child behaves or not,<strong> they should never be ridiculed, tormented or devalued in any way</strong>. It’s important to know that <strong>you're loved for who you are, but you're not always liked if you misbehave</strong>”</p><p>“A smack can be administered there and then - <strong>so the child associates this punishment with what they've done JUST THEN</strong> - it's potentially less powerful when you have to wait to get them home to send to their rooms, withdraw treats etc.”</p><p>“A parent should not strike a child when they are not in control of themselves - <strong>it should be an act of discipline, not an attack</strong>”</p><h2></h2><h2><strong>2. Smacking *should not* be allowed</strong></h2><h3><strong>Argument 1 - It teaches the wrong lessons</strong></h3><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Wrong-lessons_formatted.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“Smacking is <strong>an expression of the parent’s anger rather than a discipline method</strong> that will benefit the child. <strong>Through anger a child learns anger</strong>. A child needs to be shown what expected behaviour is through positive parenting and role modelling”</p><p>“It is counter-intuitive to hit a child because he hit his sister. <strong>'Hitting is wrong. To show you this, I am going to hit you.' That will make no sense to a child</strong>; or rather, it will just further <strong>teach the child that hitting is an appropriate way to deal with problems</strong>”</p><p>“<strong>Violence and potential injury and humiliation are not just causes</strong> for teaching children how to behave. Children learn from example”</p><p><strong>“It teaches children that being stronger gives you the right to have power over others.</strong> I was smacked very frequently as a child, and it never stopped me behaving badly. It was my mother who did the smacking, and I do not feel any great love for her”</p><p>“<strong>It teaches that violence is the way to get your way</strong>. It does more for the parent's ego than helps the child and demonstrates a loss of control”</p><i>None</i><h3><strong>Argument 2 - There are alternatives</strong></h3><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Smacking_PA_formatted.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“<strong>It’s not acceptable to say ‘if used at all it would be a last resort’</strong> in which case one is saying that when all else fails it's OK to hit the kids! <strong>Hardly a strong intellectual basis for causing pain to someone you love</strong>”</p><p>“I was smacked as a child and it made me vow never to do that to my own when I grew up, which I didn't. <strong>All it took was a stern look and "the voice" to make them stop in their tracks and think about what they were doing</strong>”</p><p>“There are few situations that I can think of where a child deserves a smack, and <strong>if you raise your child in a loving environment where you talk through issues rather than raising a hand</strong>, that child will grow up with the same values”</p><p>“<strong>Striking a child who can understand a voice command or rational statement is not good.</strong> An adult dog or cat will understands a sharp voice command, but not a puppy or a kitten”</p><p>“<strong>It is illegal to smack a child in Sweden and it works for them</strong>!”</p><p>“There is a popular view among some parents that 'no smacking means no discipline', <strong>which it doesn't</strong>”</p><h3><strong>Argument 3 - You can't smack an adult</strong><strong><br></strong></h3><p>“<strong>There are really no situations where smacking another adult is acceptable. So the same should be for children.</strong> When you think about it in that way, we do not need to ban smacking we need to look inwards into ourselves and ask what is right!”</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/SmackAdults_formatted.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“<strong>Adults don't smack other adults when they consider them to misbehave</strong> - as they surely do - so why should adults be allowed to attack the most vulnerable people in society?”</p><p>“<strong>You shouldn't smack a child in the same way that you shouldn't smack an adul</strong>t, perhaps even more so considering their comparative vulnerability”</p><p>“<strong>We frown upon men 'smacking' their partners</strong> or even women 'smacking' their partners so why is it acceptable to smack a child?”</p><h3><strong>Argument 4 - It can be used excessively</strong></h3><p>“Some people<strong> do not know their own strength and a child can be easily injured</strong>. If smacking is used once it will be used frequently and I do not think that a child should have to put up with that”</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/excessively_formatted.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“If smacking becomes part a 'normal' response,<strong> it may have a tendency to increase in both frequency and severity</strong> as it is hard to see where else to go with it if it hasn't achieved the desired result”</p><p>“Parents need to show self-control;<strong> if you need to intervene physically then you have lost control of the situation</strong>”</p><p>“<strong>People differ in their definition of ‘reddened skin’</strong> and therefore a child's experience of smacking with some parents is likely to be a beating by the standards of another parent. <strong>We should be more civilized and able to respond in a more intelligent way</strong>”</p><p>“<strong>When smacking is clearly designed to alleviate the parents own angry/frustration</strong> and not really to try to teach the child that what they are doing that is potentially dangerous etc. that to me is abuse”</p><h2><strong>3. </strong><strong></strong><strong>Alternatives to Smacking</strong></h2><h3><strong><strong>Positive reinforcement</strong></strong></h3><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Positive_formatted.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“Children misbehave to get attention;<strong> if you give them attention when they are well behaved</strong> they don't have to act up to get your attention”</p><p>“The constant battle is to <strong>positively reinforce good behaviour and warn and punish against bad behaviour</strong>”</p><p>“Bringing up children is hard and time-consuming.

Children are, by nature, very selfish minded and thus do not like having something taken away from them.<strong> If the alternative is sitting quietly, then they will certainly take that if it means they get to watch their TV programme later or have some chocolate in the afternoon</strong>”</p><p>“<strong>Lock up their gadgets for 2 weeks minimum, and if they throw a tantrum, extend it to three weeks</strong>, and so on. They'll either get the message… or phone Childline"<strong></strong></p><h3><strong><span>Reason with them</span></strong></h3><p>“People should say 'that's naughty' when an action has been so. <strong>Most children's actions are not wilfully naughty, they just don't understand the rules and boundaries yet</strong>, and it is a parents place to teach them, not be violent with them”</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Reasoning-with-them_formatted.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“Talk to them, and levy punishment. Also, <strong>understand why they are misbehaving</strong> - toddlers get bored when shopping or listening to adults talking - make sure they are entertained. Young children become over-tired and misbehave; reduce their stimulation.<strong> Just listen to your children and spend time with them - it's easy enough to understand why they're playing up if you pay attention</strong>”</p><p>“It is possible to explain most situations to even very young children<strong> if they are done in a contextual way at their level of understanding</strong>”</p><p>“<strong>Do not enter into an argument with them</strong> but sternly, without shouting, remind them who feeds them and clothes them and who's house it is, and say no more”</p><h3><strong><span>Keep consistency</span></strong></h3><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Consistent_formatted.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>'One has to be consistent and fair,<strong> if you have said no then the other parent should say no also</strong>. If you have threatened a child by saying ' you do that again and we won't go to the park' then <strong>you must be prepared to carry out that threat</strong>”</p><p>“Well<strong> simply DOING what you threaten gives the child some idea of boundaries and what is and isn't acceptable</strong> - so whether that's withdrawing privileges, sending to bed early, taking them home, just to do what you're threatening may have some impact - but <strong>not following through just makes parents look out of control and weak</strong>&rdquo"</p><p>“<strong>Withdrawal of privileges only works as long as the threat is carried out and that the penalties are proportionate.</strong> Idle threats only make matters worse, excessive penalties result in resentment. It is a difficult balance”</p><p>“Unless you stick absolutely rigidly to your discipline, <strong>NEVER threaten but not follow through</strong>, you're going to finish up being tramped all over”</p><h2>4. <strong></strong><strong> </strong><strong>Is legislating smacking a good idea?<br></strong></h2><p>“Parents are expected to have responsibility for the care and upkeep of their children. <strong>Why should the State interfere with the discipline side of this?</strong> If more parents had maintained tight discipline, we would not see so many thugs around whom seem insensible to pain they inflict on others”</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Legislation_formatted.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“All children are different and<strong> it's not always the place for psychiatrists and politicians to second guess everything that parents do</strong>. Some children require more discipline than others and<strong> it's important to find out what works for each individual child</strong>”</p><p>“Most parents who smack their children do it maybe once or twice in their child's lifetime. <strong>Those parents who beat their children senseless and abuse their children will do this whether 'smacking' is prohibited or not. </strong>And as beating up children is already illegal, this will do nothing to stop that kind of behaviour”</p><p>“I think that as long as they are not hurting, endangering or humiliating a child,<strong> parents should be allowed to discipline in their own way</strong>”</p><p>“<strong>I do not think parents should be punished when they are at their wits' end trying to get their children to behave</strong>: it is much better for society than those who do not even try to discipline their children”</p><p>“Discipline can be very hard in real-life situations, especially at the extremes, and I think<strong> it's unreasonable to implicitly expect every parent to be an expert in child psychology and to keep their cool at all times in all situations</strong>”</p><p>“<strong>Can I also raise the issue of children who are screamed at and belittled in the home and in public by the 'grown ups' around them - bullying without the physical</strong> <strong>contact</strong>. How would a ban on smacking protect them?”</p><p>“<strong>I was smacked and I turned out fine...</strong> *gibber...twitch*”</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/LabsLine.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h2><strong><strong><strong>Reasonable chastisement or a form of child abuse?
