The former President grabbed his right ear before diving to the ground. Agents rushed the stage, covering Trump, before ushering him into a waiting vehicle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TIM240805-Trump-Cover.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Click here<strong> </strong>to order<a href=#> this cover</a> or <a href=#>a copy of this issue </a>of TIME</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he was “shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through my skin,” Trump wrote. “Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening.”&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Photos taken on scene showed the former President with an injury to his right ear and blood on his face. He pumped his fist and yelled "Fight!" to supporters as he was led away, prompting cheers from the crowd.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The suspected shooter fired multiple shots toward the stage from an elevated position that was outside of the rally venue, according to Anthony Guglielmi, a Secret Service spokesman. One attendee was killed, and two others were critically injured, Guglielmi said in a statement. The suspected shooter was “neutralized” by a Secret Service agent and later died, Guglielmi said.</p><h2 class="font-itc-franklin-gothic-std mb-5 w-full border-b border-time-gray-7 pb-5 text-center text-base font-semibold uppercase leading-tight lg:text-left">What We Know So Far About the Trump Rally Shooting</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In his post on Truth Social, Trump said that nothing was known yet about the shooter. A video shared with TIME showed officers removing a body from the scene.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">James Sweetland, a retired emergency room physician, told TIME at the scene that he performed CPR on a man who had been shot in the head and had blood coming out of his mouth. “He wasn't breathing,” said Sweetland, 70, whose shirt was stained with blood. “I got other people to help me get him on one of the benches, and we got CPR going on him. I could not feel a pulse.” It was unclear if the man survived.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Scott Sosso, 47, was sitting in the bleachers with his son Luka, 18, when the shots rang out. “You hear pop, pop, pop,” Sosso said. “Ten seconds later, you hear ‘Someone is shot!' Next thing you know, everybody got down in our section.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/donald-trump-rally-shooting-2024-01.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Darrin Mohney, 36, said the shooting sounded like fireworks. “Everybody just kind of froze, and the next thing you know, after the second round and the third shot, everybody just started hitting the deck,” he said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Speaking to news cameras Saturday evening from Rehoboth, Del., President Biden said he had been “thoroughly briefed” by Secret Service and Homeland Security officials. “I have tried to get a hold of Donald. He was with his doctors. I plan on talking to him shortly”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Look, there is no place in America for this kind of violence,” Biden said. “It’s sick. It’s sick. It’s one of the reasons we’ve got to unite the country. We cannot allow for this to be happening. We cannot be like this. We cannot condone this.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When a reporter asked if he thought it was an assassination attempt, Biden said, “I have an opinion, but I don’t have any facts.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Biden campaign said it was “pausing all outbound communications and working to pull down our television ads as quickly as possible,” according to a campaign official.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/donald-trump-rally-shooting-2024-02.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Former President George W. Bush expressed gratitude that Trump was safe “following the cowardly attack on his life.”&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Many at the scene were filled with disbelief and outrage at the massive security failure that allowed an armed individual to fire at a former President.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I’m shocked that someone was able to get a shot off, but not that they attempted to do it,” says Danny Altmire, 56.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">House Oversight Chairman James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, said he had contacted the Secret Service for a briefing and called on the agency's director Kimberly Cheatle to appear for a hearing. In a separate statement, he condemned what he called an "assassination attempt."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Republican Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, a finalist to be Trump’s running mate, suggested in a post on X that the Biden campaign’s rhetoric led to the incident.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Today is not just some isolated incident,” Vance <a href=#>wrote</a>. “The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all cost. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump’s attempted assassination.”&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Donald Trump Jr. told TIME in a text message that his father was “in great spirits. He will never stop fighting to save America, no matter what the radical left throws at him.”&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">With reporting by Brian Bennett and Vera Bergengruen/Washington</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWltgHF%2Bjq2prqWgYr%2BiuMuyZKygn6TBqrrGZmlo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftrump-rally-shooting-2.html&text=Eyewitness%20Accounts%20From%20the%20Trump%20Rally%20Shooting&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftrump-rally-shooting-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftrump-rally-shooting-2.html&title=Eyewitness%20Accounts%20From%20the%20Trump%20Rally%20Shooting" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftrump-rally-shooting-2.html&title=Eyewitness%20Accounts%20From%20the%20Trump%20Rally%20Shooting" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftrump-rally-shooting-2.html&title=Eyewitness%20Accounts%20From%20the%20Trump%20Rally%20Shooting" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftrump-rally-shooting-2.html&description=Eyewitness%20Accounts%20From%20the%20Trump%20Rally%20Shooting" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./pulse-recipe-how-to-make-ofada-stew-watch.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to make ofada stew (WATCH)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./afghanistan-soldier-surprises-daughter-video.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Afghanistan Soldier Surprises Daughter: Video">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
