Many of the pods on this year’s roundup try to explain our current political and social moment.

The wide-ranging series, which aims to give new context and grapple with the complicated legacy of slavery in the United States, included a podcast hosted by Nikole Hannah-Jones that tells that story through narrative, archival audio and essay-like observations. Different New York Times writers offer their invaluable insights, most notably in the third episode, “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Birth of American Music</a>,” which Pulitzer-winning critic Wesley Morris begins with a meditation on the carefree joys of yacht rock and traces the origins of that genre — and all quintessentially American sound — to its roots in black American music.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Episode to Get Hooked On: </strong>“Episode 3: The Birth of American Music with Wesley Morris”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Listen on Apple Podcasts</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">2 Black Girls, 1 Rose</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/2-black-girls-1-rose-best-podcasts-2019.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Genre:</strong> Culture</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Why You Should Listen: </strong>Bachelor and Bachelorette superfans Natasha Scott and Justine Kay aren’t afraid to call out the sexist and racist blunders of the often-problematic show on their podcast, 2 Black Girls, 1 Rose.

In each episode, Gethard offers a master class in empathy. He subtly encourages callers to share more details about their lives while remaining respectful of their privacy. Even within an episode the topics can span from the serious (a gay man raised in the Mormon church discusses his struggle with faith and sexuality) to the trivial (that same man talking about <a href=# rel=noopener>electric scooters</a> littering the streets of Salt Lake City). The podcast reached a moment of transcendence last year when a survivor of a mass shooting called in to share the details of her experience.

Chief among them: How did Nassar get away with hurting so many women and girls for so long? Through interviews with survivors, hosts Lindsey Smith and Kate Wells try to explain how Nassar established his reputation as a “good guy” and how the people around him ignored or even enabled his behavior. It’s not always an easy listen, but it’s an essential one as listeners are forced to examine society’s larger role in one monster’s crimes.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Episode to Get Hooked On: </strong>“The Good Guy”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Listen on Apple Podcasts</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The Big One</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/best_podcasts_thebigone.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Genre: </strong>Science</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Why You Should Listen:</strong> It’s hard to understand inevitable devastation in the abstract. We know California is due for a massive earthquake that could hit any second, but we don’t like to think about the details — the buildings that will collapse, the people who will be trapped, the lives that will be lost. To confront the possibilities would only spur existential dread. But that’s exactly what the Big One aims to do, putting you in the shoes of someone in downtown Los Angeles experiencing the earthquake as it happens. The podcast isn’t entirely fiction: Host and KPCC science reporter Jacob Margolis interviews earthquake survivors, scientists and even LA’s mayor about the inevitable disaster and its consequences.

Many women enter pregnancy without enough information and must educate themselves about not only bodily changes but complications and problems as they experience them. It can be strange and scary. Bryn Huntpalmer does the important work of interviewing women about the most intimate moment of their lives. Each episode presents a new birth story, told in painstaking detail, from morning sickness to the medical lingo overheard in the delivery room.

Unburdened by questions about guilt or innocence, host Kai Wright takes a critical and essential look at the juvenile criminal justice system and how it helps or hurts young, impressionable teenagers.

That’s a good thing considering that a lot of shows in the genre indulge their hosts’ worst instincts, spending too much time on unsupported conspiracy theories or focusing on the killer over the victims. The subject of The Clearing, however, is not killer Edward Wayne Edwards, but his daughter, April Balascio. As she reached middle age, Balascio began to wonder if her father might actually be a murder and called the police with her suspicions, eventually leading to his arrest in a cold case.

Plus, there’s already countless podcasts where comedians interview other comedians — each with a gimmick. Conan O’Brien’s particular schtick is that he doesn’t have any real friends (not on his payroll) and hopes to bond with his guests. Thankfully, he dispenses with this premise a few minutes into each episode and reverts back to the skills that help make him the longest-working late-night host in the U.S.: his weird vibe charms and disarms guests, along with a genuine curiosity about his subjects.

So far, every episode has been completely engrossing. She began with an examination of a group of Sherlock fans convinced that John Watson (played by Martin Freeman) and Sherlock Holmes (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) would become a couple. The contingent defended the theory with passion, eventually even harassing and starting fights with Sherlock fans who disagreed with them. The Sherlock creators eventually expressed doubts about the future of the series simply because the <a href=# rel=noopener>toxicity of the fandom</a> has become so overwhelming. Paskin examines the many factors that contributed to this controversy‚ from a genuine desire to see gay characters on TV to an evolving feeling among fans that they, not the writers, know what’s best for a character. With each case study — from a viral shark song to our obsession with “sad Jennifer Aniston” — Paskin gets closer to identifying why people cling to what may seem like arbitrary tidbits of popular culture.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Episode to Get Hooked On: </strong>“The Johnlock Conspiracy”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Listen on Apple Podcasts</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Dolly Parton’s America</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/best_podcasts_dolly_partons_america.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Genre:</strong> Culture</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Why You Should Listen:</strong> With this podcast, Radiolab co-creator Jad Abumrad dispels any notion that Dolly Parton is a punchline.

Pulling from 12 hours of interviews he did with the country legend, archival interviews with Parton and analysis from music journalists, Abumrad masterfully traces the arc of Parton’s career — from writing about banned topics like pregnancy, abortion and domestic abuse to her more joyful fare. He argues that analyzing her universal appeal, regardless of listeners’ background or politics, will help us understand America at this particular moment.

But the show really heats up around the Oscars when Richard Lawson, Katey Rich, Mike Hogan and Joanna Robinson and a rotating series of guests obsess over every snub and scandal in the lead-up to Hollywood’s biggest night.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Episode to Get Hooked On: </strong>“Predicting the 2020 Oscars”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Listen on Apple Podcasts</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Longform</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/longform-best-podcasts-2019.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Genre:</strong> Interview</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Why You Should Listen:</strong> Anyone remotely interested in the writing process should tune into this podcast. Hosts Aaron Lammer, Max Linsky and Evan Ratliff invite journalists like New Yorker writer Malcolm Gladwell and New York Times White House correspondent Maggie Haberman to talk about their work, their process and, most crucially, their journey to their current position. Writers, editors and anyone who enjoys movies like Spotlight will geek out over the discussions of process — like the small aside an interviewee makes that breaks a story. But even if you’re not interested in writing, the emotional journeys will resonate with you: It turns out just about every person with a recognizable byline has experienced imposter syndrome.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Episode to Get Hooked On:</strong> “#354: Jia Tolentino”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Listen on Apple Podcasts</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Moonface</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/best_podcasts_moonface.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Genre:</strong> Fiction</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Why You Should Listen:</strong> This lived-in story pulls sounds directly from the Los Angeles suburb of Downey, drawing the listener into the neighborhood of its protagonist Paul (voiced by Joel Kim Booster). Paul is an aspiring podcaster — and the show takes some well-deserved jabs at an industry still dominated by straight, white men — but has found himself floundering in adulthood. Despite Paul’s ability to communicate emotion on audio, he struggles with conversations in real life, particularly with his mother. She speaks primarily Korean, and he has never managed to grasp the language. The linguistic barrier creates an emotional one, and Paul admits to a new boyfriend that he has not yet come out to his mother. The story trusts non-Korean speakers to follow some Korean dialogue and, in doing so, explores how people understand each other, though language or deeds.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Episode to Get Hooked On: “</strong>Chapter 1: Into The Past”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Listen on Apple Podcasts</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">No Feeling Is Final</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/no-feeling-is-final-best-podcasts-2019.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Genre:</strong> Society</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Why You Should Listen:</strong> Australian podcaster Honor Eastly has pulled off something rare, creating a visceral podcast about mental health.

The podcast explores some of the most public and ridiculous business implosions in history, from brawls in the U-Haul boardroom to MoviePass’ rapid rise and fall. Perhaps the most disturbing undercurrent is the fact that so many of the founders and CEOs behind these companies — including Donald Trump, who has an episode dedicated to his Atlantic City casino fiasco — snatch up golden parachutes or simply declare bankruptcy and start over again, while workers are left without jobs. “Failing up,” it seems, has become an essential business strategy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Episode to Get Hooked On:</strong> “MoviePass begins with plenty of drama”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">The Sporkful</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/the-sporkful-best-podcasts-2019-new.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Genre:</strong> Food</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Why You Should Listen:</strong> The James Beard Award-winning podcast covers all things food, from interviews with celebrity chefs to questions like whether a takeout burger is inferior to one served at a sit-down restaurant.
