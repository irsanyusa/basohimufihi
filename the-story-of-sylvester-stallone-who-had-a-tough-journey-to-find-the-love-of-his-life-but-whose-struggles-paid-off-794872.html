And although now we&nbsp;can call their <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> happy, their <a href=# title="love story" data-link=tag>love story</a> wasn`t always perfect. The road to&nbsp;where they are now was rocky, but their <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> has been going strong for a&nbsp;very long time. And we&nbsp;can only hope that this beautiful couple stays together even longer!</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> have taken a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;Sylvester Stallone’s and Jennifer Flavin’s love story. Let’s see how their relationship evolved!</p><p><h2>Before Jennifer</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;1974, when Sylvester Stallone was&nbsp;28, he&nbsp;married photographer Sasha Czack. Together they had 2&nbsp;sons, Sage and Seargeoh. The marriage lasted 10&nbsp;years, and in&nbsp;1985 the couple got divorced.</p><p>Almost a&nbsp;year later, Stallone married model and actress Brigitte Nielsen. They had only known each other for a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;months, and from the very beginning Brigitte felt it&nbsp;was too early for them to&nbsp;get married, but Stallone begged her&nbsp;to. Their marriage lasted for only 2&nbsp;years.</p><p><h2>How it&nbsp;all began</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;1988, Sylvester Stallone, 42&nbsp;and twice divorced, met Jennifer Flavin, who was 19&nbsp;at the time, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Beverly Hills restaurant and they started dating.</p><p>“I’d come over, and we’d watch a&nbsp;movie, cook dinner, goof around with the dog, or&nbsp;walk on&nbsp;the beach,” <a href=#>says</a> Flavin. Stallone would also spend time with Jennifer and her <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> in&nbsp;their home in&nbsp;the San Fernando Valley. Being with Jennifer seemed to&nbsp;do&nbsp;Stallone good. “I’m loving life again,” he&nbsp;<a href=#>told</a> the Toronto Star. “Jennifer has made all the difference.”</p><p>However, their relationship wasn`t perfect. “When we&nbsp;come together, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;wonderful,” Stallone <a href=#>said</a> in&nbsp;1991. “When we&nbsp;are separate, there are no&nbsp;strings attached. That’s the way it&nbsp;is. No&nbsp;strings.”</p><p>Here`s what Jennifer had to&nbsp;<a href=#>say</a> about this: “I’m not naive about what may go&nbsp;on&nbsp;when I’m not around&nbsp;— he’s a&nbsp;45-year-old man&nbsp;— I&nbsp;can’t change the way he&nbsp;is.” “Still, he’s not a&nbsp;cheating dog every day of&nbsp;the week. We&nbsp;spend 5&nbsp;out of&nbsp;7&nbsp;nights together, so&nbsp;I don’t know where he’d find the time.”</p><p>Flavin would often hear rumors about Stallone being unfaithful to&nbsp;her. But she wanted to&nbsp;see the best in&nbsp;him and to&nbsp;believe him when he&nbsp;said he&nbsp;was innocent. She <a href=#>said</a>, “I&nbsp;know he&nbsp;loves&nbsp;me. So&nbsp;it&nbsp;was never an&nbsp;issue.”</p><p><h2>An&nbsp;unexpected breakup</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;1994, however, Stallone ended their relationship via FedEx. He&nbsp;sent her a&nbsp;6-page letter dumping her after more than 5&nbsp;years together.</p><p>Jennifer <a href=#>was</a> devastated when she received that letter. “I&nbsp;cried a&nbsp;lot. I&nbsp;called all my&nbsp;friends. And I&nbsp;cleaned my&nbsp;apartment about 5&nbsp;times. I&nbsp;had so&nbsp;many pictures and things to&nbsp;get rid&nbsp;of.”</p><p>She <a href=#>was</a> also disappointed that Stallone couldn`t break up&nbsp;with her face-to-face and instead just sent her a&nbsp;letter. “You can’t just write somebody off in&nbsp;a&nbsp;letter after 6&nbsp;years. It’s not like&nbsp;I was going to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;beg him to&nbsp;come back to&nbsp;me&nbsp;or&nbsp;anything. I&nbsp;just wanted to&nbsp;talk.”</p><p>She later learned from her agent that Stallone had been having an&nbsp;affair with model Janice Dickinson, who gave birth to&nbsp;a&nbsp;daughter in&nbsp;1994 that Stallone thought was his.</p><p>But this tough breakup didn`t leave her resentful. “Everybody thinks&nbsp;I should still be&nbsp;upset,”&nbsp;— she <a href=#>says</a>,&nbsp;— “But since the news I’ve just been carrying on&nbsp;with my&nbsp;life. I&nbsp;mean, we&nbsp;broke&nbsp;up, and it’s a&nbsp;major part of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life. It&nbsp;was hurtful, but you learn by&nbsp;your mistakes, and you pick up&nbsp;the pieces and carry&nbsp;on.”</p><p>Later a&nbsp;DNA test proved that Stallone wasn`t the father of&nbsp;Janice Dickinson`s daughter and the relationship ended. He&nbsp;then dated several other models and even got engaged to&nbsp;Angie Everhart, but their relationship didn`t last.</p><p><h2>And they lived happily ever after.</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;1995, Jennifer and Sylvester got back together, welcomed their first daughter Sophia in&nbsp;1996 and got married in&nbsp;1997.</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;statement, Stallone <a href=#>said</a>: “I&nbsp;have had 2&nbsp;great things happen to&nbsp;me&nbsp;in&nbsp;the past year: the birth of&nbsp;our beautiful daughter Sophia Rose and now my&nbsp;marriage to&nbsp;Jennifer, who is&nbsp;a&nbsp;great mother and&nbsp;I know will be&nbsp;a&nbsp;wonderful wife.”</p><p>Jennifer and Sylvester, who currently live in&nbsp;Los Angeles, have 3&nbsp;daughters together.</p><p>“I’ve never had more fun. I&nbsp;learned that from my&nbsp;wife... It&nbsp;took me&nbsp;19&nbsp;years to&nbsp;realize she’s always right. I&nbsp;<a href=#>realized</a> that women have a&nbsp;knack, at&nbsp;least Jennifer, for making incredibly erudite, wise, smart decisions. I&nbsp;always leap without looking. She always looks and never leaps. She’s incredibly safe. So&nbsp;now finally, I&nbsp;say: ’Honey, you make all the decisions. Done, done, done. I&nbsp;trust you.’ I&nbsp;never had that before. Ever.”</p><p>Did you know Sylvester Stallone`s love story? Do&nbsp;you know anyone whose relationship didn`t start out perfect but ended up&nbsp;well and strong?
