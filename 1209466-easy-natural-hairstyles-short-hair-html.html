Do you want to be trendy together with us? Join in and check out these awesome hairstyles for women with short hair!</p><h3>1. Short haircut with the shaved sides</h3><p class=align-left>This style is created for combining a few different styles in one, and it does not look like there is something excess. Instead, it looks like the elements from a few various styles were joined in a very graceful way. For instance, if you have no desire to shave off your sides, but still want to try out shaving, you can do it just partially, with leaving the curls on top of your head. The small hair sections were sheared, but this haircut has a very modern look, and you are guaranteed to become one of the trendsetters of your community.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bb3da7613c513996.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 short and protective natural hairstyles for beautiful African women</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4180644a31786d29.png><h3>2. Natural Mohawk with the caramel highlights</h3><p class=align-left>This haircut is your proof that the caramel highlights will always look gorgeous on the natural black hair. It has always been a very nice combination, and since the caramel dye has a lot of lighter and darker tones, it also allows you to experiment with them and figure out which one is the best one for your hair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/aa6dc6fa8a58fc07.jpg><h3>3. Beautiful extra-short twa-cut</h3><p class=align-left>The teeny-weeny afro is like a regular afro hairstyle, only it is very short, and the curls are barely visible. The African women who enjoy very short natural hairstyles often make this choice when it is summer, and they feel like they are unable to survive the hot season with long hair or extensions. And let us say, none of them has regretted about this choice, because teeny-weeny afro is not just lovely but also very practical.</p><p class=align-left>As for the twa-cut, it is just like the mentioned before Afro but incorporated into a nice gradual haircut with the geometric lines behind the ears. The famous actress Halle Berry used to have the similar hairstyle once, and we are sure that if she pulled this off, we would also be able to rock it in our everyday life.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3782c8e0ee100a96.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>See the top-13 trendy braids for your amazing short natural hair</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bb3da7613c513996.jpg><h3>4. Golden blonde curly hair with the geometric side shaved designs</h3><p class=align-left>Look at this hairstyle – it truly requires a lot of courage and skills to create. But sometimes, when you want a truly unforgettable look that others will recognize you for, you have got to take some risks. The benefit of this hairstyle is that it frames your head very nicely, and also will be your friend on the especially hot days. It will also suit the party girls who are used to having fun until the sunrise.</p><p class=align-left>The blonde colour looks very memorable together with the dark skin, and you will be accepted as a warm person with a big heart. Also, these intricate designs on your shaved sides are really something exceptional. They add a lot of mystery and originality to the look, making it very artistic. If you have never thought about golden blonde short hairstyle, then maybe you have finally found what you have been looking for?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4a3496fba5b16c31.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazing big twist hairstyles for the natural hair enthusiasts</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d84e4e09fe703d3e.jpg><h3>5. Colourful Afro with the pops of orange</h3><p class=align-left>The long afro looks beautiful, but it may be problematic to maintain such a hairstyle. Here is a solution for the women who prefer shorter hair – the short afro with a lot of colourful orange tons. This is the look which would be absolutely perfect for the start of autumn because when you look at all these colours, you start thinking of the beautiful falling autumn leaves and the multicoloured shades of the trees.</p><p class=align-left>If you are into photography, your self-portraits could turn out really incredible. The curly spirals that the hairstyle is made of are very carefully blended into each other, so no one can see the start and end of each shade. If you are a lady who loves bright autumn and considers herself to have a fiery personality, you should absolutely go for this hairstyle!</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Trendy braids for short natural hair to rock in 2018</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt3bc00m5e1sa.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 20 trendy natural hairstyles for short hair</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d62c432676187c1c.jpg><h3>6. Natural hair with the shaved sides</h3><p class=align-left>What if you have a natural bunch of hair, and would like to do something special with it? This is possible if you choose a hairstyle like this one. First of all, the natural hair will have a rest from all the chemicals and hair care products, and get a nice break, while also looking on point. Second of all, you can add some warm brown colour, just to make things interesting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3782c8e0ee100a96.jpg><h3>7. Nice summer haircut with highlights</h3><p class=align-left>You may have noticed that after a few days of having the same hairstyle, you start thinking that the hair looks slightly frizzy, which means that it is time for washing it again. However, washing is not always the best approach. Instead of going to shower, you can try something different. For instance, you can use some of your favourite hair care nutrients, like oils or wax, and add a considerable amount of them to your natural locks every three or four days, just when you start thinking it has lost its appeal.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt32skuum5gqg.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 15 natural hairstyles that you can wear every day</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt6vhmig1omb7.jpg><h3>8. Twa cut with the straight line and shaved sides</h3><p class=align-left>This is one of the hairstyles which is a definition of “back to basics”, but it does not mean that it is not cute and attractive. For the black women, there are a lot of very simple natural hairstyles that will always look very appealing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4a3496fba5b16c31.jpg><h3>9. Short haircut with side parting</h3><p class=align-left>When your hair is extra short, and you are struggling to grow it, you are usually disappointed that there are not a lot of options for creating a hairstyle that will be trendy and will suit you. However, this is not true. Even with the short natural curls, you can do a lot of creative things.</p><p class=align-left>For example, have a look at this natural haircut with the parting on the side. This adds an extra charm and originality to what seems to be the plain old short afro. If you are not a fan of anything edgy or rebellious, but would like your short hairstyle to be different from all the others, look healthy and push the curls out of the way when you are busy with something, you should go for this style with parting, or maybe even try to create some very small cornrows.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt233tmt1vknk.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Check out best protective hairstyles for natural hair</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Very short natural hairstyles for real fashionistas</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1f07e6d14565ce8d.jpg><h3>10. Short messy curls</h3><p class=align-left>This is also a very simple style that has a massive potential for creating some more interesting variations. It can make you look like a Hollywood superstar if you are up to dressing formally or help you rock the simple and elegant look when you are going out with your friends.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt3bc00m5e1sa.jpg><h3>11. Two-toned natural curls</h3><p class=align-left>This is another example of how nicely the caramel highlights can look with the natural black hair. This is the look that would work out in a lot of situations because the caramel colour is a perfect match with the dark skin. Here is a little tip on how to preserve the definition of your curls. To keep them well-defined, you should shampoo your hair while being the shower.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/832c1e5a3cef36ed.jpg><h3>12. African Frohawk</h3><p class=align-left>If you are searching for the best way to add some fun and uniqueness to your natural hairstyle, then your first option would be, undoubtedly, the Mohawk haircut. However, not every person is completely ready to get a full-on Mohawk. This is why this chic and cheerful alternate option is ideal for those who would like to try something daring but are not up for the bold experimenting.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4lpl3ohcpne.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 beautiful natural hairstyles for African women in 2018</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This frohawk looks amazing with the natural strands of hair, and it preserves the original edginess of its sister hairstyle – Mohawk, while also remaining very stylish and keeping its own charming nature. It will be a very nice choice for the sporty girls who are always in search of something new and lack some excitement in their lives.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Rihanna's short hairstyles front and back view</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e2cde1b96f26f5a4.jpg><h3>13. Short chick haircut with the burgundy red highlights</h3><p class=align-left>Do you want to add some colour to your hair, but are still uncertain on what would suit you? Perhaps you would like to try something different than the usual natural hair dye? Then, the burgundy red hue would be a perfect choice for the natural hair. It will make even the simplest short curly hairstyle more interesting and eye-catching. Besides, different shades of red would work here, no matter if these are copper-red or plum red tones. You have a chance to choose what works best for you.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5053c1b57b291bcb.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 60 black natural hairstyles for medium-length hair in 2024</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This is a hairstyle that works as a reverse for the trendy and fashionable ombre because it fades upwards into the bright coils.

Vintage curls with the knotted headscarf</h3><p class=align-left>The accessory can change the look of every hairstyle, which is why so many African ladies tend to rely on them for adding spice and originality to their usual looks. The most popular accessories for natural hair are headbands, bandanas, and, of course, headscarves. This is a very timeless look, which reminds everyone of the last century fashion, but is still charming and makes people think of you as a gorgeous guest from the past.</p><p class=align-left>It is very versatile and can be worn in many different ways, not just the one that is shown in the picture. Another benefit of this style is that the headscarf will protect your natural hair in a very effective way.
