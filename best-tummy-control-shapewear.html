Thankfully, the days of wearing tight undergarments that squeeze the soft parts of the body to the point of breathlessness are gone. Modern shapewear is designed to make you feel (and look) good, while being able to move comfortably instead of constricting.</p><p>I was really excited to try out this new “era” of tummy control shapewear. With summer coming, I wanted a few lightweight undergarments to wear underneath my warm-weather dresses, shorts, and skirts.</p><p>I've spent the last month trying out a variety of styles from half-slips and shorts to bodysuits and tank tops to discover what works best. I was curious about the hype surrounding some of these items—so I’ve constructed a list to recommend the most flattering and sculpting shapewear for the midsection, based on where women want support the most when dressing up or just hanging out.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-tummy-control-shapewear>Our top picks for the best tummy control shapewear</h2><h3>Best affordable tummy control shapewear: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Maidenform Firm-Control High-Waist Shaping Brief</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best affordable tummy control shapewear</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Maidenform Firm-Control High-Waist Shaping Brief</h3></p><p>This high-waist brief from Maidenform had a lot of compression and a little less comfortability factor. But at under $30, I recommend it if you are on a budget and looking for a brief versus a thong or boy short style. It stayed put and didn’t roll, even when I moved around in it. I didn’t love having so much compression over my stomach area for a long time, but it definitely flattened things out. I wore it under a dress for a cocktail party, and while I appreciated that it smoothed down my mid-section, I was happy to take it off at the end of the night. It has over 5,000 five-star reviews on Amazon, so even if it wasn’t my favorite, others really love it.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/b4da2095222e0019a34d4cb33d90b421/0b500/maidenform-without.jpg></span></span><p>MAYA DOLLARHIDE / Without Maidenform shapewear</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/29b500ac08150527232d8656a3d8384b/df922/maidenform-with.jpg></span></span><p>MAYA DOLLARHIDE / iStock</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/30fb14df88d547389e0418753fcdebe6/0d838/maidenform-withside.jpg></span></span><p>MAYA DOLLARHIDE / With Maidenform shapewear</p><h4>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Sizes: Small to 3XL</li><li>Colors: Latte and black</li><li>Material: Nylon and elastane</li><li>Price on publish: $27.00</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Great compression</li><li>Didn’t roll down</li><li>Affordable</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Not comfortable (for me personally) after a few hours</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>If you are looking for shapewear with a brief bottom, this affordable option offers firm control and smoothing under clothing.</p><h3>Best tummy control shapewear for dresses: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Commando Classic Control Short</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best tummy control shapewear for dresses</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Commando Classic Control Short</h3></p><p>I am a long-time fan of this brand, and one of my favorite items is these shaping shorts to wear under jumper dresses, skirts, and slacks. These smooth out the lower half of your body, feel so soft and silky (and non-constrictive), and are ultra lightweight to the point that you practically forget you are wearing them. I am comfortable in these all day (or night) and they go on and off easily, unlike some of the competitors. These are hands-down my favorite shapewear shorts. They fit easily under all my clothes and elevate my confidence and my outfit. I could (and have) worn these all day, but if you are looking for a lot of compression, there may be better choices.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/206f7fd515fc3279f63c7ba3ed112c22/330a9/commando-without-front.jpg></span></span><p>MAYA DOLLARHIDE / Without Commando</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/eaa499a819088d449a1684393e4aacbc/89642/commando-side-with.jpg></span></span><p>MAYA DOLLARHIDE / Without Commando</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/bda7dbae03c404fe48e13c48d1aa3772/60d12/skimside.jpg></span></span><p>MAYA DOLLARHIDE / With Commando</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/82a1b6be528fa93fecd24d90b04e8d65/56e92/spanx-waist-cincher-withoutside.jpg></span></span><p>MAYA DOLLARHIDE / With Commando</p><h4>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Sizes: XS to 3X</li><li>Colors: Beige, caramel, black, and mocha</li><li>Material: Spandex, nylon, and cotton</li><li>Price on publish: $58.00</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Extremely easy to get on and off</li><li>Contouring but comfortable</li><li>Silky soft</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>May run a little long if you are petite</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Silky smooth shapewear shorts that you can wear all day or night without sacrificing comfort.</p><h3>Best tummy control bodysuit and best plus size tummy control shapewear: <a rel=nofollow href=#>SKIMS Seamless Sculpt Brief Bodysuit</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best tummy control bodysuit and best plus size tummy control shapewear</span></p><p><h3 class=title>SKIMS Seamless Sculpt Brief Bodysuit</h3></p><p>This bodysuit is so great it topped two of our categories. According to its maker, the SKIMS seamless sculpt brief bodysuit is designed to “provide support without adding bulk or sacrificing comfort.” The bodysuit has snaps at the bottom and adjustable straps, and neither one caused any discomfort, other than feeling a little squeezed by the end of the day. My colleague, however, raves about her SKIMS. She wore it to a high school reunion, and it was comfortable and confidence-boosting all day long. SKIMS wins best bodysuit because of the level of compression and comfortability and best plus size because of rave reviews and inclusive sizing. The brand says machine washable, but I would opt to hand wash.

I was tempted to roll down the upfront portion just to enjoy the lower portion of the bodysuit, and I’m going to buy the Nearly Naked Shaping High Waist Short from Yitty. This brand is owned by the Grammy award-winning singer Lizzo, who designed size-inclusive shapewear for all. I love this. And I loved the open gusset so I could pee without struggling with snaps. This bodysuit moved with my body, and while it had a little less compression than some, I appreciated that I could feel comfortable wearing a shorter dress and still have some thigh coverage.</p><h4>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Sizes: XS-5X (some <a rel=nofollow href=#>sizes go larger to 6X</a>)</li><li>Colors: Four core colors plus three limited options in bright yellow, orange, and a navy blue</li><li>Material: Recycled Nylon, Nylon, and Elastane</li><li>Price on publish: $69.95</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Bright color options</li><li>Comfortable lower shorts section of bodysuit</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Runs a little big snug - I had to pull it up and move it around to get comfortable</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Shapewear bodysuit that has biker shorts bottom from a size-inclusive brand.</p><h3>Runner-up for best bodysuit with tummy control: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Shapellx Power Conceal Full Body Tummy Control Shapewear</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Runner-up for best bodysuit with tummy control</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Shapellx Power Conceal Full Body Tummy Control Shapewear</h3></p><p>This was my runner-up pick for the best bodysuit, namely because it was a little more difficult to get on and off, and I appreciated that the website actually addressed this issue and explained the best way to put it on. It kept everything together, and I felt secure in it, even without an additional bra. Instead of snaps, there is an opening in the bottom part of the bodysuit; at first, I didn’t like it, but I appreciated not having to worry that the snaps would come undone. The material is breathable but a little bit thicker than I liked. That being said, it has hundreds of positive and glowing reviews, so I would recommend it to a friend.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/235e539f3803a8014341f40491bed189/76902/shapemint-without.jpg></span></span><p>Maya Dollarhide / without shapellx</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/0c14b04e8c45e589e7bd3af1a4b1e38e/76902/shapemint-on.jpg></span></span><p>Maya Dollarhide / with shapellx</p><h4>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Sizes: XS/S to 5X</li><li>Colors: Five neutral shades plus one pink</li><li>Material: Spandex and nylon</li><li>Price on publish: $54</li></ul><h4>What we like</h4><ul><li>Open crotch design</li><li>Size inclusive (I love the range of sizes from XXS to 5X)</li><li>Mid-range compression</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like</h4><ul><li>It takes patience to put on</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>A bodysuit with biker short legs for fuller coverage in the mid-range of your body with hundreds of glowing reviews.</p><h3>Best tummy-control shapewear corset: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Spanx Suit Your Fancy Shaping Waist Cincher</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best tummy-control shapewear corset</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Spanx Suit Your Fancy Shaping Waist Cincher</h3></p><p>This works great if you just want to shape and sculpt your midsection without having to wear a full bodysuit or shorts. I found this to be comfortable (you just slip it on over your head and wiggle it down your body or step into it and pull it up). It stayed up without rolling or slipping down, and the seamless top and bottom didn’t dig into my skin. While there are pieces of shapewear designed to look more like a corset, you can’t really see the boning, and I would not recommend wearing it as outerwear, which some people (younger than me, lol) might do. Spanx (and reviewers) says its cinching design creates an hourglass silhouette, and it received high marks from customers. However, I noticed compression versus cinching in my waist for an hourglass. I liked that it didn’t show through my clothes (I tried it on with a white shirt), as well.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/8f675257290d95f0f58cbd843651a04a/681bf/yummietank-without.jpg></span></span><p>MAYA DOLLARHIDE / without Spanx Suit</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/time.com/shopping/static/14fe8efd041e93bb25e55ef0a7b33363/1bd72/boyfriend-yummietankside.jpg></span></span><p>MAYA DOLLARHIDE / with Spanx Suit</p><h4>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Sizes: XS to XL</li><li>Colors: Nude and black</li><li>Material: N/A</li><li>Price on publish: $74.00</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Seamless</li><li>Firm compression</li><li>Can help create the illusion of an hourglass figure</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Does not come in a size bigger than XL</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>This waist cincher is easy to put on and take off, doesn’t roll down, and for some, will help create an hourglass silhouette.</p><h3>Best tummy-control shapewear slip: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Knix LuxeLift Slip</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best tummy-control shapewear slip</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Knix LuxeLift Slip</h3></p><p>I have a few dresses that call for a slip, so I was happy to try this one and see how it holds up against regular silk or cotton slips, which are my usual go-to. The Knix slip was comfortable and lightweight enough not to feel bulky underneath my dress. I removed the pads in the cup and bust area and found the slip much more comfortable without them. I would have liked a little more support in the mid-section with this slip. I found that the top fit well and then it was a little loose. If you are wearing this for tummy control with a sheer dress, you might want to consider a bodysuit instead. But I appreciated the support up top, and the slip provided enough coverage for me. It probably won't work well with a tight dress because of the amount of fabric, but it was great for flowy, warm-weather outfits. I love how soft it is and that it doesn’t stick to my body. I would probably use this as a slip with support versus compressive shapewear.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></span></span><p>MAYA DOLLARHIDE / Without Knix LuxeLift Slip</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></span></span><p>MAYA DOLLARHIDE / With Knix LuxeLift Slip</p><h4>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Sizes: S to XXXL+</li><li>Colors: Six neutral colors</li><li>Material: Nylon and spandex</li><li>Price on publish: $69.00</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Seamless</li><li>Comfortable</li><li>Removable cups</li><li>Works well with short, midi, or longer dresses</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>May not offer enough compression in the tummy area</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>If you are looking for a slip with some supportive control in a seamless design, this comfortable design from Knix is a great choice.</p><h3>Best thong shapewear for tummy control: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Commando Classic Control Bodysuit</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best thong shapewear for tummy control</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Commando Classic Control Bodysuit</h3></p><p>If you are looking for a no-seam bodysuit and don’t need super strong compression, just something that keeps everything smooth, this is my favorite choice for everyday wear. It has a cotton gusset panel, breathable fabric, and adjustable straps. While it may not offer enough support for some individuals without the addition of a bra, it is a great layering piece. If you need some coverage but want to stay comfy and gently supported, this classic by Commando is a strong contender.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></span></span><p>MAYA DOLLARHIDE / without Commando Bodysuit</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></span></span><p>MAYA DOLLARHIDE / with Commando Bodysuit</p><h4>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Sizes: XS to XL</li><li>Colors: Black and beige</li><li>Material: European microfiber</li><li>Price on publish: $98.00</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Seamless</li><li>Very comfortable</li><li>Offers smooth, gentle support</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Only goes up to size X-large</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>This is a solid option for an everyday bodysuit that stretches and moves with your natural shape, keeping everything smooth and gently supported.</p><h3>Best tummy-control shapewear shorts: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Shapermint Essentials All Day Every Day High-Waisted Shaper Shorts</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best tummy-control shapewear shorts</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Shapermint Essentials All Day Every Day High-Waisted Shaper Shorts</h3></p><p>These are thicker than my beloved Commando shorts and have a higher waist for better coverage. I really liked these shorts for the compression. I felt like all my bits and bobs were tucked in, yet the material was comfortable enough to wear for several hours. They went on and off easily, although I had to tug a bit to pull the top part of the shorts up. They are thicker fabric than some, so I think I would opt to wear these in cooler weather. These shorts provided excellent coverage for my midsection down to my mid-thigh, but if you are petite like me, the length may cause them to peek out of shorter dresses or skirts. They didn’t roll down, like some others I tried, after a few hours of movement, which I appreciated.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></span></span><p>MAYA DOLLARHIDE / Without Shapermint Shorts</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></span></span><p>MAYA DOLLARHIDE / With Shapermint Shorts</p><h4>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Sizes: XS/S to 4XL</li><li>Colors: Five</li><li>Material: Nylon and spandex</li><li>Price on publish: $52.00</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Doesn’t roll down</li><li>Soft</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>May run a little long if you are petite</li><li>The material felt a little thick to me</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Shapewear shorts that stay put and provide excellent coverage.</p><h3>Best tummy control shapewear tank top: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Yummie Boyfriend Yummie Tummie Three-Panel Shaping Tank</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best tummy control shapewear tank top</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Boyfriend Yummie Tummie® 3-Panel Shaping Tank</h3></p><p>I loved wearing this tank top underneath my sweater because it was soft and didn’t ride up like some tank tops. It was a bit of a struggle to get on, but it stayed put. While I wouldn’t wear this as outerwear, I liked that it gave me an extra layer of control. While the fabric wasn’t super compressive across the tummy, it was form-fitting enough to help hold me in, and the panel of material at the bottom meant the tank didn’t bunch up—I tried it tucked and untucked, and each way, it stayed put.</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></span></span><p>MAYA DOLLARHIDE / Without Yummie Boyfriend Tank</p><span><span class=gatsby-resp-image-wrapper><span class=gatsby-resp-image-background-image></span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src></span></span><p>MAYA DOLLARHIDE / With Yummie Boyfriend Tank</p><h4>Specifications</h4><ul><li>Sizes: XS to 3X</li><li>Colors: White, black and almond</li><li>Material: Polyester, spandex and cotton</li><li>Price on publish: $42.00</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Doesn’t roll up</li><li>Inexpensive for shapewear</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>May not offer enough chest support for some sizes</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>While I wouldn’t wear it as a tank top, it provided three panels of support (top, middle, and bottom) and kept things smooth under my sweater.</p><h2 id=how-i-selected-the-best-shapewear-for-tummy-control>How I selected the best shapewear for tummy control</h2><h3>I personally tested each item</h3><p>I tried on a lot of pieces to find the <a rel=alternate href=#>best shapewear</a>. Some items made the list, others didn’t based on comfort, compression, fit, and function. I put each piece of shapewear through hours of testing, involving standing, sitting, and walking for periods of time to measure comfort, support, and how well each stayed in place. I wore each item with clothing that you’d normally wear with shapewear—dresses, pants, and tops with a fitted silhouette. For bodysuits and shorts, I also considered how easy it would be to make a bathroom trip.</p><h3>I researched reviews and polled colleagues and friends</h3><p>I spoke to colleagues and friends about the shapewear they like and why, and what they recommend to others. I also took careful note of user reviews of each item for the same input.</p><h3>I scoured the shapewear market</h3><p>I did a deep dive into the world of shapewear apparel to learn more about what kinds of pieces are out there and what they are designed to do. I made sure to consider a wide range of styles, from bodysuits to shorts, tanks to slips.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-choosing-a-shapewear-for-tummy-control>What to consider when choosing a shapewear for tummy control</h2><p>When shopping for shapewear, you should consider a few factors based on your style preference, compression level needs, and budget.</p><h3>Style</h3><p>The <a rel=alternate href=#>best lingerie brands</a> offer shapewear that comes in many different styles, from boy shorts to slips. In fact, I didn’t realize that “tummy control” could be found in well-designed tank tops, too. Consider how you will be wearing your shapewear. Are you looking for a body suit to shape and smooth under a fancy dress or an undershirt to smooth out folds while wearing a pair of high-waisted pants?</p><h3>Compression</h3><p>Most shapewear contains materials that have a degree (or many more) of compression to keep your body pulled in at the waist or other areas. I tried on some items with a lot of compression, and although they looked good, they felt slightly tight after a few hours) before finding some with just enough support without the discomfort. Shapewear brands will usually contain information about the amount of compression in the product.</p><h3>Material</h3><p>Most shapewear is made of spandex and nylon, although some are mixed with cotton or other materials. It depends on the brand and manufacturer. One thing I can’t stand is itchy undergarments, which is the worst. Everything that made our list is no-itch, although some are softer than others. If you prefer <a rel=alternate href=#>cotton underwear</a> or shapewear, several of these items also come with a cotton gusset panel.</p><h3>Budget</h3><p>Shapewear is pricey, with some pieces costing hundreds of dollars. This can feel like a lot for a small piece of fabric, no matter how transforming it is. Think about how much you can afford to spend and opt for items that will pull double duty in your undergarment wardrobe.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Which shapewear is best for a lower belly pooch?</h3><p>A great choice for a lower belly pooch is an item with high-rise control that holds your belly in, creating a smooth look from the lower to the upper body.</p><h3>Does shapewear really work?</h3><p>Most shapewear does work, and depending on the amount of compression, it could potentially take up to one to two inches off your waistline—it is always best to use a measuring tape to see how many inches! Shapewear can help sculpt your body using compression fabric to create a smoother line underneath your clothing. Like the <a rel=alternate href=#>best bras</a> on the market, shapewear works to bring support to other parts of your body.</p><h3>Can shapewear reduce belly fat?</h3><p>No. Shapewear cannot reduce belly fat, although high compression may make your shape appear slimmer. When you remove it, your body remains the same.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lpKq6rsWMnKanrKKkuW6%2Fx5qnnq%2BVlr9w</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbest-tummy-control-shapewear.html&text=Best%20Tummy%20Control%20Shapewear%2c%20Tested%20and%20Reviewed&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-tummy-control-shapewear.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-tummy-control-shapewear.html&title=Best%20Tummy%20Control%20Shapewear%2c%20Tested%20and%20Reviewed" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbest-tummy-control-shapewear.html&title=Best%20Tummy%20Control%20Shapewear%2c%20Tested%20and%20Reviewed" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbest-tummy-control-shapewear.html&title=Best%20Tummy%20Control%20Shapewear%2c%20Tested%20and%20Reviewed" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-tummy-control-shapewear.html&description=Best%20Tummy%20Control%20Shapewear%2c%20Tested%20and%20Reviewed" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./funke-akindele-announces-film-finding-me.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Funke Akindele announces film Finding Me">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./un-decret-fixe-les-capacites-minimales-des-accueils-de-jour.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Un dcret fixe les capacits minimales des accueils de jour">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
