Aside from that, almost all of&nbsp;Picasso’s close friends didn’t like Olga much and his mother personally advised him against the <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> encourage you to&nbsp;read the story of&nbsp;their <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a>, proving once again that beauty is&nbsp;in&nbsp;the eye of&nbsp;the beholder.</p><p><h2>The wedding day of Picasso and Khokhlova.

In&nbsp;a&nbsp;way, it&nbsp;was an&nbsp;office romance.</p><p>In&nbsp;<a href=# title=Paris data-link=tag>Paris</a> at&nbsp;war (it&nbsp;was the First World War), the new ballet show <a href=#>Parade</a> was supposed to&nbsp;premiere. Its creators were going to&nbsp;shock the public. Olga Khokhlova took part in&nbsp;the rehearsals as&nbsp;a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;the <a href=#>Diaghilev ballet group</a>, and Picasso worked on&nbsp;creating the original decorations and costumes for Parade.</p><p>So, the artist’s eye quickly noticed the most attractive muse among all the others.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c76/8c9/d60e8251e195fad14b2bdef3c1.jpg><p>Group of&nbsp;dancers. Olga Khokhlova is&nbsp;lying in&nbsp;the foreground, 1919-1920.</p><p>In&nbsp;the beginning, Olga was cautious with Picasso’s attention, and she said that his insisting compromised her. Diaghilev decided to&nbsp;help the passionate artist see that Russian girls, especially the ones from good <a href=# title=families data-link=tag>families</a>, are not ready to&nbsp;start romantic relationships. Picasso followed his recommendations so&nbsp;carefully that just one year later, Olga and he&nbsp;got married in&nbsp;Paris and even had a&nbsp;church wedding (because the bride wanted&nbsp;it) in&nbsp;the local Orthodox cathedral. This wasn’t enough for Picasso, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;offered her a&nbsp;prenuptial agreement that stated that 1/2 of&nbsp;all the his income belonged to&nbsp;his beloved wife.</p><p><h2>Portrait of Olga in the Armchair, 1917</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0b1/915/c3b85457aca61e679120b2376b.jpg><p>Before the wedding, there was an&nbsp;unpleasant incident. Because Pablo was a&nbsp;good son, he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;share the good news with his mother and introduce Olga to&nbsp;her. Señora Picasso was not delighted about the news and she also told her future daughter-in-law that her son was a&nbsp;bad choice. She said that he&nbsp;was unable to&nbsp;make any woman happy. According to&nbsp;her, Pablo was too obsessed with himself. But people in&nbsp;love rarely pay attention to&nbsp;these warnings...</p><p><h2>Portrait of Olga Khokhlova, 1918</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ef6/dff/847b6a5488a864ace5f1f3e15f.jpg><p>After the wedding, the newlyweds moved into a&nbsp;new 2-story apartment. Olga didn’t do&nbsp;any ballet, partially because she had had a&nbsp;recent leg injury that happened by&nbsp;accident, and partially because of&nbsp;her new marital status. One year after they got married, Picasso received a&nbsp;letter from Sergey Diaghilev where he&nbsp;invited Pablo to&nbsp;come to&nbsp;London and also asked about his wife:</p><p>“And what about Olga? Has she really abandoned the art of&nbsp;dance? This is&nbsp;quite sad! Massine regrets this as&nbsp;a&nbsp;choreographer, and I&nbsp;as a&nbsp;former fan.”</p><p>But Madame Picasso was not interested in&nbsp;dance anymore and she drew all of&nbsp;her attention to&nbsp;their house. The artist’s friends who had gotten used to&nbsp;his bohemian lifestyle were amazed at&nbsp;Picasso’s expensive suits, his golden watch, a&nbsp;man driving his car, and at&nbsp;the perfect order in&nbsp;his house. Well, at&nbsp;least, in&nbsp;one part of&nbsp;the house, on&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the 2&nbsp;floors. On&nbsp;the second, Picasso had his workshop where he&nbsp;didn’t care much about how it&nbsp;looked. But the first floor was elegant, very stylish, and very clean. Olga was in&nbsp;charge of&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>Pablo Picasso and Olga Khokhlova in the workshop, 1919</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/387/f0e/bb0efd5d7aaac7d5151bf05309.jpg><p>Just like any talented person, Pablo had a&nbsp;soft spot for experiments. He&nbsp;was in&nbsp;a&nbsp;constant search of&nbsp;new forms and new sources of&nbsp;inspiration. It’s safe to&nbsp;say that his entire new lifestyle, his beautiful aristocratic wife, his suits, his butlers, his drivers, his purebred dogs&nbsp;— all this was sort of&nbsp;an&nbsp;experiment. A&nbsp;new form of&nbsp;art, life as&nbsp;art. At&nbsp;about the same time, he&nbsp;became interested in&nbsp;neo-classicism. Biography experts tell a&nbsp;popular story about a&nbsp;time when Olga once looked at&nbsp;her husband’s painting and told him that she wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;recognize her face in&nbsp;his paintings. And allegedly, after that, Picasso moderated his interest in&nbsp;avant-garde and went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;more classical forms.</p><p><h2>Portrait of Olga, 1919</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bb5/0aa/7afa2b55d6ace504676cae0f28.jpg><p>We&nbsp;can’t say that Olga had very ordinary interests. Her grandson Bernard Ruiz-Picasso (now co-founder of&nbsp;the Picasso Museum in&nbsp;Malaga with his mother Christine Ruiz-Picasso, and is&nbsp;president of&nbsp;its Advisory Committee) remembers today how his grandmother was not afraid of&nbsp;leaving her home when she was quite young and leaving her entire family behind in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Russia data-link=tag>Russia</a>. She got the job on&nbsp;the Diaghilev team which was very popular at&nbsp;that time and she was even friends with Coco Chanel. So, she was a&nbsp;bright, smart, and open-minded woman.</p><p>The family life of&nbsp;the couple was pretty smooth in&nbsp;the beginning and the only bad things were the worrying letter from Russia. In&nbsp;1919, Olga received news from home that her father, an&nbsp;army general, had disappeared, and her brothers were fighting in&nbsp;the Civil War. Her mother and her sisters were starving. She sent them money and her husband’s paintings hoping they would help them survive the difficult times, but the postal service was terrible at&nbsp;the time and there was no&nbsp;guarantee that the packages would reach them.</p><p>At&nbsp;this period of&nbsp;their marriage, Picasso often drew Olga as&nbsp;a&nbsp;reflective and sad woman, deep in&nbsp;her thoughts. It&nbsp;wasn’t because he&nbsp;was inspired by&nbsp;sadness and asked his wife to&nbsp;make serious faces, but because at&nbsp;that time, Olga really was in&nbsp;this mood pretty often.</p><p><h2>Seated woman (Olga), 1920</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2b1/cac/625c705361a6c8dd13df6e4e86.jpg><p>A&nbsp;great distraction for Olga and a&nbsp;new source of&nbsp;pride and inspiration for Picasso was their son Paulo. The boy was born in&nbsp;1921. Thanks to&nbsp;him, Olga sort of&nbsp;returned back to&nbsp;life: in&nbsp;the painting and photos, she smiles a&nbsp;lot and looks happy. Picasso drew a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;very tender portraits of&nbsp;his wife and their little son.</p><p><h2>Mother and Child, 1921</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/197/203/807c3f5525b722929154887888.jpg><p>Sometime later, Pablo was either tired of&nbsp;playing this role or&nbsp;was sick of&nbsp;his friends’ jokes about his lifestyle, and a&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;falling out started in&nbsp;the family. Pablo was very tired of&nbsp;the endless social events and dinners, and according to&nbsp;him, Olga was too invested into her son: she allowed him to&nbsp;do&nbsp;too much and was too protective of&nbsp;him. Pablo started to&nbsp;express all of&nbsp;his bad feelings toward his wife in&nbsp;his paintings. He&nbsp;was irritated with her love for trendy clothes, the people around her, and even her way of&nbsp;thinking.</p><p><h2>Portrait of woman in d`hermine pass (Olga), 1923</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ded/17e/b1799753e1bea8c10ba57e61cd.jpg><p>In&nbsp;January 1927, <a href=#>Picasso</a> met 17-year-old Marie-Thérèse Walter and the title of&nbsp;muse passed from Olga to&nbsp;her. Several years later, everyone knew what was going&nbsp;on. Walter gave birth to&nbsp;Picasso’s daughter. After Khokhlova found out about her husband’s second life, she took Paulo and left immediately. Picasso tried to&nbsp;get divorced from her but the prenuptial agreement that they had signed many years ago forced him to&nbsp;split all of&nbsp;his property into 2&nbsp;halves. The artist refused to&nbsp;give away his work and there were other legal troubles, so&nbsp;<a href=#>Olga</a> remained his wife until the day she died in&nbsp;1955.</p><p><h2>Head of a Woman in a Hat, 1935</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/acc/079/237b6b568ebdb15790bba2a9f3.jpg><p>After they broke&nbsp;up, Olga’s reputation and health took a&nbsp;huge toll on&nbsp;her. Picasso himself said nasty things about her several times, especially when she would start a&nbsp;fight or&nbsp;speak out against him. Olga felt betrayed and she kept sending letters to&nbsp;him that were full of&nbsp;sadness. She also sent Picasso pictures of&nbsp;his son and she would even follow him on&nbsp;the street, yelling, “You shouldn’t pretend that&nbsp;I don’t exist!”</p><p>While both the ballet dancer and the artist were alive, the public supported Picasso. His charisma and his success in&nbsp;art made people forget that both of&nbsp;them were to&nbsp;blame.</p><p>By&nbsp;the way, Marie-Thérèse Walter was only Pablo’s inspiration for a&nbsp;short time. He&nbsp;changed muses regularly and sometimes they even met each other. One of&nbsp;the women even <a href=#>quotes</a> Picasso’s words when Walter and another of&nbsp;Pablo’s lovers insisted on&nbsp;him making a&nbsp;choice between them, “<strong>I&nbsp;was satisfied with things as&nbsp;they were. I&nbsp;told them they’d have to&nbsp;fight it&nbsp;out themselves. So&nbsp;they began to&nbsp;wrestle. It’s one of&nbsp;my&nbsp;choicest memories.</strong>”</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think, did this story even have a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;end well?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZL2qr8CsqqhllKeyuHnPqKmtqpGewbR5zp9koaGjYsSqssRmnaiqXaKur8WMspyaqqNirq%2BwjK2fnrFdqLWww4yhprBlmJ7Abq3TraCtrZSaerW71pqpnWWYmr9ur8eapaCdlGKEdoCYb2do</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpicasso-drew-portraits-of-his-wife-for-many-years-and-they-show-how-his-attitude-toward-her-changed-754960.html&text=Picasso%20Drew%20Portraits%20of%20His%20Wife%20for%20Many%20Years%2c%20and%20They%20Show%20How%20His%20Attitude%20Toward%20Her%20Changed&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpicasso-drew-portraits-of-his-wife-for-many-years-and-they-show-how-his-attitude-toward-her-changed-754960.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpicasso-drew-portraits-of-his-wife-for-many-years-and-they-show-how-his-attitude-toward-her-changed-754960.html&title=Picasso%20Drew%20Portraits%20of%20His%20Wife%20for%20Many%20Years%2c%20and%20They%20Show%20How%20His%20Attitude%20Toward%20Her%20Changed" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpicasso-drew-portraits-of-his-wife-for-many-years-and-they-show-how-his-attitude-toward-her-changed-754960.html&title=Picasso%20Drew%20Portraits%20of%20His%20Wife%20for%20Many%20Years%2c%20and%20They%20Show%20How%20His%20Attitude%20Toward%20Her%20Changed" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpicasso-drew-portraits-of-his-wife-for-many-years-and-they-show-how-his-attitude-toward-her-changed-754960.html&title=Picasso%20Drew%20Portraits%20of%20His%20Wife%20for%20Many%20Years%2c%20and%20They%20Show%20How%20His%20Attitude%20Toward%20Her%20Changed" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpicasso-drew-portraits-of-his-wife-for-many-years-and-they-show-how-his-attitude-toward-her-changed-754960.html&description=Picasso%20Drew%20Portraits%20of%20His%20Wife%20for%20Many%20Years%2c%20and%20They%20Show%20How%20His%20Attitude%20Toward%20Her%20Changed" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./night-work-early-death.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Shift Work: Night Shifts Linked to Early Death">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lexperimentation-de-la-garantie-jeunes-prolongee-jusqua-fin-2017.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="L'exprimentation de la garantie jeunes prolonge jusqu' fin 2017">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
