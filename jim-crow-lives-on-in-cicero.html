In the early 1950s the industrial Chicago suburb achieved another, uglier kind of infamy after a young black bus driver and his family moved into the all-white town. A mob of several thousand whites hounded them out of Cicero and set fire to their furniture as police stood idly by. Today, some 30 years later there are still rackets and plenty of brawling honky-tonks along South Cicero Avenue. And the town is still astoundingly white. Indeed, residents seem nostalgic about Capone’s gang and as panicked as ever about the specter of a black invasion. Al didn’t bother us much in Cicero,” says a retired foundry worker who was a boy when Capone came to town, “and we didn’t bother him. But we can’t count on the colored not to bother us like Al did.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Now the Justice Department has stepped in to make sure Cicero is bothered It charges that Cicero officials have gone out of their way to violate two federal laws by keeping blacks off the municipal payroll and preventing blacks from moving into town at all. U.S. Attorney Dan Webb calls it perhaps “the most egregious, aggravated case of race discrimination” his office has ever prosecuted. The statistical evidence is stark. The 1980 census found only 74 blacks in a population of 61,232, despite the fact that adjacent Chicago is 40% black. Not one of Cicero’s schoolchildren is black. Nor are any of its 400 municipal workers, since Cicero requires that its employees live there for a year before they can be hired.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Justice Department charges that town officials have threatened and “physically harassed” prospective black residents. All but seven of Cicero’s blacks work at Sportsman’s Park Race Track and live on the grounds in cinder-block huts for the eight months the thoroughbreds are running. “I don’t go far from the track,” says Raymond Johnson, 31 a groom since 1976. “It’s just a known fact: Cicero is Cicero, the same as it’s always been—racist. You watch your step.” In the fall of 1980, two black race-track families enrolled their children in Drexel Elementary School, three blocks away. A crowd of glaring white parents forewarned, confronted the five children on their first day of school. The principal declared that he could not guarantee their safety. The youngsters did not return after the first week, and no black in Cicero has dared to register since.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ronnie Stackhouse, 23, a black who manages a fried-chicken restaurant in nearby Forest Park, rented an apartment in Cicero last February. His car was promptly shot at and, in April, firebombed. At police headquarters, while Stackhouse was describing the attack his scarred car parked just outside was battered again. When he went back inside to report the new violence, police arrested him for disorderly conduct. “I get a lot of harassment,” says Stackhouse, who lives with his wife and two children. “People yelling at me from cars. Right now the neighbors don’t yell too much. I guess they got used to me.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Cicero is a compact community, just 5.5 sq. mi. Its squat houses were mostly built between 1910 and 1940, when thousands of East European immigrants swarmed in to take factory jobs. Today Cicero’s tidy yellow-brick houses are owned mainly by the thrifty children and grandchildren of thrifty Poles, Czechs Lithuanians and Yugoslavs.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">To them, Cicero is snug, not bigoted They say that the prices of their brick bungalows will fall if a black family moves near by. “What people fear here is not skin color,” says Real Estate Salesman Eugene Bielawa, “but devaluation of what they’ve worked all their lives fora nice home.” Restaurateur Christos Rozos, who came from Greece in 1962 is wary of black Americans. “Why do they want to move here?” he wonders. “We’ve spent a lot of money to make this street beautiful.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A decade ago, Western Electric employed 22,000 people in Cicero. It remains the biggest employer today, even though its work force has dwindled to barely 4,000. Some 900 Western Electric employees are black, and about 4,000 other blacks work in Cicero. Whites seem to have reconciled themselves to the black commuters. “Let the colored come to work in Cicero,” says a comparatively tolerant Western Electric worker. “That’s fine. The dollar is democratic. But we’d just as soon they sleep elsewhere.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At the McDonald’s on Cermak Road, the main commercial street, there were 100 patrons one day last week but not a black in the place. “Oh, we get a few colored in here,” said a grandmotherly woman behind the counter. “In fact, I think I sold a Big Mac to one a couple of weeks ago.” In Boulevard Manor, the most expensive part of town, a black face is not merely remarkable, but alarming. )own here,” says a Manor resident, anyone who sees a colored person walking along the street without a delivery uniform on calls the police.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Cicero can claim some recent ethnic diversification. About 5,000 Mexican Americans live on the shabby eastern edge of town, a sort of buffer with black west Chicago. Some 400 Asians live in Cicero as well. “Slant-eyed people may look funny,” says a white Cicero truck driver, “but they work hard, stick to themselves, and keep their places clean.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Town officials are hunkering down for a long court fight against what they call forced housing.” Rumor has it that a few hotheads are forming a violent, Klan-like squad. But even residents bitter about the prospect of black neighbors are, for the most part, unhysterical. “We don’t want them living here,” a Western Electric worker says, “but I don’t think we’d have shooting or anything like that.” A Polish-American welder is similarly resigned: “I’ll stand it as long as I can, and then leave Cicero if I have to. But I’m not gonna burn a cross or reach for my rifle We’ve come too far for that in this country.” That is a slight but hopeful recognition in a town that has clearly not come far enough.—By Kurt Andersen.
