Before this date, we had NEVER had unprotected sex. I was very adamant about it. Your wedding night is the time to consummate the marriage.</p><p>Well, my wedding night we did that but he also knowingly exposed me to his HIV. I trusted him with my life and he took my life into his own hands and chose to lie in the most explainable way!</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>From that trip to the doctor when he said his HIV test was negative, to his mom telling me to ask him about HIV and he saying he didn't know what she was talking about just days before the wedding, to having unprotected sex with his WIFE on our wedding night, to the doctor telling me that I WAS HIV POSITIVE, to me finding out about other women and possibly men he was sleeping with, and ALL THE WAY UP TO SENTENCING he lied!</p><p>When the judge said, 'we have you on a recorded conversation admitting that you had HIV since 2002,' the lies stopped!</p><p>I was 24 years old on this day August 4, 2007, and on this day, my body was introduced to HIV."</p><p>In addition, she said once she spoke out, others who had slept with her husband began to come forward, like another woman who he’d infected while his wife was pregnant, while another 100 women who allegedly had sex with the man also coming out of the closet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdktKq%2F02ijoq6Zo7Rutc1mp5qhnqh6uLvMmqVmm5WhsqO%2BwK2crGVhZXq6scCrqmanlmK1qsKMoqWfnZOptrC6jJ%2BpqKVdncK0rsCnm2aumZmysHvPs61wqJZq</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fliving-in-pains-woman-celebrates-10-years-of-hiv-infection-from-husband-video.html&text=Woman%20celebrates%2010%20years%20of%20HIV%20infection%20from%20husband%20%5bVideo%5d&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fliving-in-pains-woman-celebrates-10-years-of-hiv-infection-from-husband-video.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fliving-in-pains-woman-celebrates-10-years-of-hiv-infection-from-husband-video.html&title=Woman%20celebrates%2010%20years%20of%20HIV%20infection%20from%20husband%20%5bVideo%5d" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fliving-in-pains-woman-celebrates-10-years-of-hiv-infection-from-husband-video.html&title=Woman%20celebrates%2010%20years%20of%20HIV%20infection%20from%20husband%20%5bVideo%5d" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fliving-in-pains-woman-celebrates-10-years-of-hiv-infection-from-husband-video.html&title=Woman%20celebrates%2010%20years%20of%20HIV%20infection%20from%20husband%20%5bVideo%5d" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fliving-in-pains-woman-celebrates-10-years-of-hiv-infection-from-husband-video.html&description=Woman%20celebrates%2010%20years%20of%20HIV%20infection%20from%20husband%20%5bVideo%5d" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./41-millions-deuros-du-fse-aux-departements-en-2010.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="41 millions d'euros du FSE aux dpartements en 2010">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-are-the-superfans-voting-on-agt-all-stars.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Are the Superfans Voting on 'AGT: All-Stars'?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
