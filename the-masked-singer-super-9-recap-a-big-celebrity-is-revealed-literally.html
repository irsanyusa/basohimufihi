The Super 9 has the top three singers from each group. That means the Kitty, Frog, Night Angel, Turtle, White Tiger, Rhino, Banana, Astronaut, and Kangaroo are fighting for the Golden Mask.</strong></p><p>But who will come out on top? And who will be unmasked tonight? It’s The Masked Singer Super 9, with our recap starting now.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-the-turtle>Who is the Turtle?</h4><p><strong><a href=#>Clues</a></strong>: Turtle’s super clue was a comic book called “The Amazing Adventures of Shellboy,” which he holds up. The comic is priced $10.13. He says, “this is not another teen clue.” His final clue is that he is “not known for just one thing.”</p><p><strong>Performance</strong>: Following the Super 9’s <a href=#>group performance</a> of “ABC,” the Turtle kicked off the solos for the night. He sang “Higher Love” by Steve Winwood and dang, I forgot just how good he is. He not only has an incredible range and tone, but those runs were something else. And there were even some dance moves thrown in this time! I would be surprised if he doesn’t make it far in the competition. He’s almost for sure a finale contender.</p><p><strong>Judges’ Guesses</strong>: Drew or Nick Lachey, Brian Littrell, Chris Evans</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-the-kangaroo>Who is the Kangaroo?</h4><p><strong><a href=#>Clues</a></strong>: Kangaroo’s super clue was an inflatable kangaroo. She presents it, saying “alright dolls, do you know who I am now?” Her final clue is that she “may be a kangaroo, but [she’s] never lived in Australia.”</p><p><strong>Performance</strong>: Again showing off her vulnerability, the Kangaroo sang “Not Ready to Make Nice” by The Dixie Chicks for the Super 9. And she honestly slayed it! Kangaroo has a solid voice, but the judges pointed out she sounded “a little nervous” this week. While it wasn’t her best song choice so far, she’s still a great singer.</p><p><strong>Judges’ Guesses</strong>: Amber Rose, LeAnn Rimes, India Arie</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-the-white-tiger>Who is the White Tiger?</h4><p><strong><a href=#>Clues</a></strong>: White Tiger’s super clue was him flossing, then shooting a basketball. He said, “swish swish!” After his performance, White Tiger claimed “I’m def not brawns–I’m brains. I even wrote a best-selling book.” And “to set the record straight” and prove how tall the White Tiger is, he stood next to a cardboard cutout of Ken Jeong.</p><p><strong>Performance</strong>: This was one of the most…bizarre songs we’ve seen performed on The Masked Singer. Singing “I’m Too Sexy” by Right Said Fred, the White Tiger definitely commanded the stage. He’s not much of a singer, but it was an entertaining, and interesting performance.</p><p><strong>Judges’ Guesses</strong>: JJ Watt, Rob Gronkowski, Joe Manganiello</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-the-kitty>Who is the Kitty?</h4><p><strong><a href=#>Clues</a></strong>: Kitty’s super clue is the <a href=# class=broken_link>Tree</a> from The Masked Singer season 2! She says she’s “not going to make this complicated, Christmas is truly the best time of year. Ring any jingle bells?” After her performance, she explains “I was not dreaming when Robert Redford helped me to get my very first role.”</p><p><strong>Performance</strong>: For some reason, Kitty’s voice sounds completely different to me hearing her sing Celine Dion’s “It’s All Coming Back to Me Now.” She still has a great voice, but it sounds fuller than before. Covering Celine Dion is no easy task and I don’t know that Kitty was up for it.</p><p><strong>Judges’ Guesses</strong>: Nicole Richie, Vanessa Hudgens, Emma Roberts</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-the-banana>Who is the Banana?</h4><p><strong><a href=#>Clues</a></strong>: Banana’s super clue was that you “might be a kindred spirit if you rocked one of these.” Then, a mullet is shown. He says, “business in the front, party in the back!” Banana is a “funny guy, but not stand-up funny.”</p><p><strong>Performance</strong>: Singing “Sweet Home Alabama” by Lynyrd Skynrd, Banana tore up the stage again. He has great stage presence and a voice to boot! Banana has been one of the most surprising singers this season. But he knows how to work the stage!</p><p><strong>Judges’ Guesses</strong>: Bret Michaels, Brad Paisley, Billy Ray Cyrus</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-the-frog>Who is the Frog?</h4><p><strong><a href=#>Clues</a></strong>: Frog’s super clue was a statue of a knight in shining armor holding a sword. He says it’s “so Ken can stop being wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong” (to the tune of “The Thong Song”). Frog claims he’s “not a trainer dancer at all.”</p><p><strong>Performance</strong>: Speaking of working the stage, no one does it better than the Frog. This week, he rapped “Jump” by Kris Kross. His dance moves are at the top of the pack now that the T-Rex was eliminated. Frog’s performances are what I’ll most look forward to every week!</p><p><strong>Judges’ Guesses</strong>: Sisqo, Omarion, Romeo</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-the-night-angel>Who is the Night Angel?</h4><p><strong><a href=#>Clues</a></strong>: Night Angel’s super clue is not an “easy clue.” She said she’d rather “ease on by with a tricky one” as a red tricycle rolls up to her. Night Angel is “not just a voice, she’s a mogul.”</p><p><strong>Performance</strong>: “Rise Up” by Andra Day is one of the most over-sung songs on talent shows recently. And I don’t think Night Angel did anything amazing with it. Compared to last week, this was just okay. But considering her vocals, she’ll stick around for a while longer.</p><p><strong>Judges’ Guesses</strong>: Tamar Braxton, Brandy, Tisha Campbell</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-the-rhino>Who is the Rhino?</h4><p><strong><a href=#>Clues</a></strong>: Rhino says he’s “risen up the Billboard charts” and you “may even have an album by him.” His super clue is a slot machine. He claims he’s a “risk-taking, gambling type” but that’s not all the clue means! Rhino is “not nearly as tall as you think [he] is.”</p><p><strong>Performance</strong>: Performing “What A Man Gotta Do” by The Jonas Brothers, Rhino showed off some new-found dance moves. He was having fun up there! I don’t think he’s a professional singer, but he’s making the most of his time on stage.</p><p><strong>Judges’ Guesses</strong>: Vince Gill, Duff McKagan, Derek Jeter</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-the-astronaut>Who is the Astronaut?</h4><p><strong><a href=#>Clues</a></strong>: Astronaut’s super clue was a record with a globe on it that he breaks. So, hinting at a World Record too obvious? He says the clue “means the world” to him. Astronaut mentions he’s “never had traditional voice training.”</p><p><strong>Performance</strong>: Astronaut closed the night by Rick Rolling us! He sang “Never Gonna Give You Up” and while his voice was good, the highlight was planting The Masked Singer flag on the stage. Gotta love the character moments! He was clearly having fun too, which made his performance entertaining to watch.</p><p><strong>Judges’ Guesses</strong>: David Archuleta, JC Chasez, Ryan Tedder</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-white-tiger-is-revealed-on-the-masked-singer-super-9>The White Tiger is Revealed on The Masked Singer Super 9</h2><p>The bottom three were announced at the end of the performances. They were the Rhino, Banana, and White Tiger. And finally, the White Tiger was chosen to be unmasked. Robin started by guessing Rob Gronkowski, which Jenny later agreed with. Nicole thought it was John Cena. Ken predicted JJ Watt.</p><p>Then, the White Tiger was revealed to be…</p><p><strong>Rob Gronkowski, former New England Patriots tight end!</strong></p><p>Another Masked Singer who we just happened to have <a href=#>predicted correctly</a>! With 8 left in the competition, we can’t wait for next week! Tune in with us again for The Masked Singer, next Wednesday at 8/7c on FOX.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/the-masked-singer-winner-1.png alt="Fans Convinced T-Shirt Accidentally Revealed Winner Of ‘Masked Singer’ Season 3" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZqWRqLimsIysoKeflad6tMHPnqlmcV2nsqStz2aYZpqZnHqkscuemauhpK56qr%2BMq5yvnZGhsqV5y6KrnqqRobm6ew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-masked-singer-super-9-recap-a-big-celebrity-is-revealed-literally.html&text=A%20BIG%20Celebrity%20is%20Revealed%21&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-masked-singer-super-9-recap-a-big-celebrity-is-revealed-literally.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-masked-singer-super-9-recap-a-big-celebrity-is-revealed-literally.html&title=A%20BIG%20Celebrity%20is%20Revealed%21" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-masked-singer-super-9-recap-a-big-celebrity-is-revealed-literally.html&title=A%20BIG%20Celebrity%20is%20Revealed%21" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-masked-singer-super-9-recap-a-big-celebrity-is-revealed-literally.html&title=A%20BIG%20Celebrity%20is%20Revealed%21" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-masked-singer-super-9-recap-a-big-celebrity-is-revealed-literally.html&description=A%20BIG%20Celebrity%20is%20Revealed%21" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./revenu-de-base-lexperimentation-se-precise-un-peu.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="l'exprimentation se prcise... un peu">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./1540414-funny-text-jokes-adults-send-friends.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="70+ funny text jokes for adults to send to your friends">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
