As the LGBTQ+ community and allies have rallied to support Mulvaney, some have criticized Bud Light for not adequately defending her‚Äîand for not being more vocal in its support of the community.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Mulvaney partnered</a> with Bud Light earlier this month and made a sponsored Instagram post for the beer that showed a custom can featuring an image of her face. The post was quickly bombarded with hateful comments and threats to boycott the company for featuring her.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Online, criticism has grown over Bud Light‚Äôs quiet retreat following the backlash. The incident has prompted further conversation about how companies treat queer representation in their marketing.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Anheuser-Busch caves to the pressure of a massive campaign against the company after it used trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney as a spokesperson for Bud Light. Read between the lines of this statement and you can see a company running scared and kicking Mulvaney to the curb. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/lMwqqgQjdy</a></p>‚Äî Benjamin Ryan (@benryanwriter) <a href=#>April 14, 2023</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Queer‚Äîand particularly transgender‚Äîrepresentation in advertising has become more common in commercials, billboards, and social media, and activists say the impact can be positive, but the queer community has long advised to be critical of superficial allyship, known as ‚Äúpinkwashing.‚Äù</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>My brother in Christ, the company who own Bud Light donate to homophobic republicans.</p><p>Anti-woke rightoids ü§ù weird leftists<br>Forgetting that pinkwashing is a thing <a href=#>https://t.co/5iA2EXm1EA</a></p>‚Äî Angie Moon üåô üíñüíúüíô (@theangiemoon) <a href=#>April 13, 2023</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In advertising, pinkwashing refers to corporations appropriating LGBTQ+ symbolism to promote their brands or products, without committing to support queer equality financially or legally. <a href=# rel=noopener>People online</a> also point out the beer producer‚Äôs previous involvement <a href=# rel=noopener>donating to politicians</a> that support anti-lgbtq policies, a classic indicator of pinkwashing. The clash is stark as anti-trans discrimination and legislation persist as a focal point in America‚Äôs political culture wars.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">More from TIME</h3><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What has Bud Light said?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Mulvaney‚Äôs video post</a> showcased Bud Light cans featuring a picture of her face, which the brand sent her as ‚Äúpossibly the best gift ever‚Äù to celebrate her ‚Äúday 365 of womanhood,‚Äù she said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The comments section, though filled with some support, quickly drew in hateful, anti-trans language, with some Instagram users misgendering Mulvaney and calling to #cancelbudlight.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Friday, Bud Light owner Anheuser-Busch released a <a href=# rel=noopener>public statement</a> on its Instagram page about the company‚Äôs history that many criticized for falling short of addressing the harassment Mulvaney faced. In the statement, CEO Brendan Whitworth said, ‚Äúwe never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people. We are in the business of bringing people together over a beer.‚Äù</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a statement to TIME, Anheuser-Busch said: ‚ÄúFrom time to time we produce unique commemorative cans for fans and for brand influencers, like Dylan Mulvaney. This commemorative can was a gift to celebrate a personal milestone and is not for sale to the general public. Anheuser-Busch works with hundreds of influencers across our brands as one of many ways to authentically connect with audiences across various demographics.‚Äù</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For some activists, Bud Light‚Äôs response has not been adequate. ‚ÄúI think that if a company is going to take a stand by being inclusive, in some way, shape, or form‚ÄîBud Light for example with Dylan Mulvaney‚Äîand there‚Äôs backlash that receives attention, the company in an ideal world would respond in a more full-throated way,‚Äù Matt Wagner, vice president of client services for Target 10, an LGBTQ+ marketing agency, tells TIME.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">‚ÄúIf I were a partner, an influencer or creator of a company or brand that received backlash, largely as a result of my very existence as a human being, I would want that company to stand up for me,‚Äù he adds</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">How have other companies handled similar controversies?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The debate online among the queer community and allies on whether to respect or drop Bud Light has been mixed, but some express disappointment that the beermaker didn‚Äôt say more to defend Mulvaney. Just a week after the Bud Light backlash, Mulvaney posted a sponsored Instagram post for her partnership with Nike that received similar response from conservative, anti-trans commenters.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Nike didn‚Äôt directly address the controversy, but the athletic brand wrote in an Instagram post that it welcomes ‚Äúcomments that contribute to a positive and constructive discussion: Be kind, be inclusive, encourage each other,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúHate speech, bullying, or other behaviors that are not in the spirit of a diverse and inclusive community will be deleted.‚Äù</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Other major brands that have begun featuring trans actors, models and influencers in their ad campaigns include <a href=#>Hershey</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Adidas</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Pantene</a>, who have been praised for sticking to their choice even in the face of opposition. In a Tweet last month, Hershey said the company values ‚Äútogetherness‚Äù and recognizes ‚Äúthe strength created by diversity.‚Äù <a href=#>M&M‚Äôs</a> on the other hand, opted to abandon its iconic colorful mascots earlier this year after polarizing backlash to the company‚Äôs stylistic tweaks of the characters. (Critics and some advertising experts called the entire M&M‚Äôs controversy <a href=#>an elaborate marketing stunt</a>.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Bob Witeck, president of Witeck Communications, who focuses on communication for brands that further LGBTQ+ advancement, argues that rather than upholding an authentic partnership, Bud Light is acting the same way that many other brands do in the face of controversy‚Äîand focusing on its bottom line instead of standing with the LGBTQ+ community. ‚ÄúThis is simply an instance when a popular retail brand paid an online influencer‚Äîin this instance, Dylan Mulvaney‚Äîto tout the product. This is done every day by some brands, especially beer and alcoholic beverages, which do not really take serious stands on social issues or causes,‚Äù Witeck tells TIME. ‚ÄúFrom their POV, it was a simple instance of putting a beer can in the hand of a celebrity.‚Äù</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>How to tell if a company‚Äôs response is sincere</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel=noopener>Queer activists and groups</a> suggest looking closely into how a company treats queer employees and handles partnerships with the LGBTQ+ community that can help consumers distinguish pinkwashing from true allyship.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For example, looking at the benefits a company offers for same-sex couples or gender-affirming health care, and whether a company has queer employees in executive leaders can be indicative of allyship. Insight into whether a company donates to queer nonprofits and advocacy groups is also a tell-tale sign. ‚ÄúAs we get closer to pride season, we will start seeing these pride promotions and pride products. Take a look at the fine print and see is it a 10% donation of all proceeds? Or is it 100%?‚Äù Wagner says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A key indicator of pinkwashing can be companies who hop on pride advertising, but privately donate to political campaigns that support anti-LGBTQ policy. Major brands like Walmart, AT&T, Comcast, and CVS Health publicly celebrate pride, but <a href=# rel=noopener>according to research</a> into their campaign finance documents, they‚Äôve collectively donated millions of dollars to state and federal lawmakers who sponsor legislation like ‚Äú<a href=#>bathroom bills</a>‚Äù that restrict transgender people from using their preferred public bathroom or efforts to limit trans children‚Äôs participation in school sports.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Although such information isn‚Äôt always publicly available or can be hard to access, Wagner recommends that consumers interested in queer-friendly brands can follow a growing class of activist-influencer-educators, such as <a href=# rel=noopener>Elle Deran</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Blair Imani</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Matt Bernstein</a>. Creators like these post about queer issues and sometimes share background on why they decide to partner with brands. People can also learn more from visiting queer news and culture sites, such as <a href=# rel=noopener>Queerty</a>, <a href=# rel=noopener>Autostraddle</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>The Advocate</a>, whose coverage is more focused on queerness than mainstream media tends to be.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamdnf3R8jpusnWWcnrSpwIydsKWZnmK6trjVmqWesV2Wu7W1jK2pmqajYq%2Bir8qlmKygXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbud-light-dylan-mulvaney-anti-trans-backlash.html&text=What%20Bud%20Light%27s%20Tepid%20Response%20to%20Anti-Trans%20Backlash%20Says&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbud-light-dylan-mulvaney-anti-trans-backlash.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbud-light-dylan-mulvaney-anti-trans-backlash.html&title=What%20Bud%20Light%27s%20Tepid%20Response%20to%20Anti-Trans%20Backlash%20Says" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbud-light-dylan-mulvaney-anti-trans-backlash.html&title=What%20Bud%20Light%27s%20Tepid%20Response%20to%20Anti-Trans%20Backlash%20Says" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbud-light-dylan-mulvaney-anti-trans-backlash.html&title=What%20Bud%20Light%27s%20Tepid%20Response%20to%20Anti-Trans%20Backlash%20Says" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbud-light-dylan-mulvaney-anti-trans-backlash.html&description=What%20Bud%20Light%27s%20Tepid%20Response%20to%20Anti-Trans%20Backlash%20Says" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./time100-companies-2022.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wyze Is one of the 2022 TIME100 Most Influential Companies">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./absenteisme-des-eleves-une-circulaire-devrait-bientot-paraitre.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="une circulaire devrait bientt paratre">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
